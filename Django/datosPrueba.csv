Runaway Indian train speeds past station without driver,"Footage shows a freight train without a driver on board speeding through a station in northern India.

Indian Railways has ordered an investigation after the unmanned train, which was on its way to Punjab from Jammu, travelled more than 70km (43.4 miles).

Officials say it began moving down a sloping track after the driver and his assistant got off for a crew change.

The 53-wagon train, carrying stone chips, moved at a speed of nearly 100km/h (around 62mph) and managed to cross about five stations before it was brought to a halt.

""The train was stopped after a railway official placed wood blocks on the tracks to stop the train,"" officials told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency.

Authorities closed off railway crossings along its path, and no-one was hurt.

Iranian women 'ready to pay the price' for defying hijab rules,"Iranian women 'ready to pay the price' for defying hijab rules Published 16 hours ago

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Iranians took to the streets across the country following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022

Azad, Donya and Bahareh don't know each other.

But the three women - whose names we've changed for their own safety - share a fierce determination to resist Iran's theocratic government, and the dress codes it has imposed on women and girls for 45 years.

So, every day, they head out of their homes in the capital Tehran - without covering their hair - despite the potential risks.

""It's very scary,"" 20-year-old music student Donya tells me over an encrypted app. ""Because they can arrest you any minute and fine you. Or torture you with lashes. The usual penalty if you're arrested is 74 lashes.""

Last month, a 33-year old Kurdish-Iranian activist, Roya Heshmati, made public that she'd been given 74 lashes after posting a photograph of herself unveiled.

But Donya, Azad and Bahareh say there is, for them, no going back.

""It is symbolic,"" says Donya. ""Because it is the regime's key to suppressing women in Iran. If this is the only way I can protest and take a step for my freedom, I'll do it.""

Image caption, Azad was left traumatised by her time in prison, saying: ""The memory of jail is with me every moment.""

The three women will also protest later this week by not turning out to vote in the country's first parliamentary elections since authorities brutally repressed the women-led uprising that followed the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022.

She had been detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Refusing to wear the hijab in public can lead to imprisonment and torture - yet many women do it anyway.

""It's true that there's no longer a strong presence of people on the streets,"" 34-year-old HR manager Azad tells me.

""But in our hearts, the regime has been completely destroyed, and people don't accept anything it does. So their way of showing their disapproval will be not to vote.""

'Solitary confinement was the worst you can imagine'

Azad was arrested in October 2022 and imprisoned for a month.

She was re-arrested in July last year, for social media posts criticising the government, and spent 120 days in jail - 21 of them in solitary confinement.

""Solitary confinement was the worst place you can imagine,"" she says. ""The cell door was locked all the time. The cell was 1m (3.3ft) by 1.5m (4.9ft). There was no outside light, but artificial lights were on day and night. We were blindfolded when we went to the toilet.""

Azad was so disturbed by the ordeal that she hit her head against the cell wall, and is still traumatised.

""Sometimes now I start crying without any reason,"" she says. ""Sometimes I don't want to open my eyes because I think I'm still there. The memory of the jail is with me every moment.""

She described interrogations that lasted from 08:00 until night-time.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Refusing to wear the hijab in public can lead to imprisonment, yet many women are prepared to take the risk

""It is called 'white torture' and it is worse than a thousand beatings. They would threaten and humiliate me. But I would mock them.""

And despite all that she's already endured, Azad's still willing to risk jail again by going out without the hijab.

""After we lost Mahsa Amini, I promised myself that I will not wear the hijab, or ever buy another one for myself or anyone else,"" she says. ""Every change has a price. And we're ready to pay it.""

Many women in Iran now go out without a headscarf, although some have one around their necks in case they're stopped by the morality police.

But I've been told that around one in five are not wearing one at all - in a daily act of bravery, defiance and principle.

""I will never give up,"" Azad messages me - followed by a heart emoji and a victory sign.

'I'm not allowed to go to work without the hijab'

But another woman I speak to in Tehran describes herself now as ""worn out"" by the struggle against the regime.

Bahareh, a 39-year old reporter and film critic, has taken a massive salary cut to work from home, rather than going into her office - where she would be forced to wear the veil.

""I'm tired and disappointed,"" she tells me. ""I'm not allowed to go to work without the hijab and I'm not willing to wear it.""

She now has to rely on her husband's salary.

Recently, while out driving without a headscarf, she was stopped by the police and had her car confiscated.

She was also arrested late last year, after posting pictures of herself without the hijab on her Instagram account and encouraging others to do the same. A Revolutionary Court gave her a six-month suspended sentence and a fine.

""I was insulted and threatened, told I was wrong and accused of inciting people to revolution and nakedness.""

Image caption, Bahareh was arrested last year after posting pictures of herself without the hijab on her Instagram account

I ask Bahareh why she thinks she wasn't actually jailed.

""Because the prisons are full of people and they prefer just to scare people like me,"" she replies.

""I still go out, but it's difficult because restaurants and cafes and bookstores can be closed down for letting me in without the hijab,"" she says. ""It makes me feel very bitter.""

We agree to delete our conversation as soon as we finish it, such is her fear of being caught talking to me. ""Then I will block you,"" she messages. ""I have no choice. If I am arrested no-one can help me and I will be accused of spying and sentenced to death.""

Terror and courage exist side-by-side for many Iranian women willing to defy the regime. Along with anger and hope.

'I panicked and my dad got scared as well'

Donya describes a recent theatre trip with her father to downtown Tehran.

She was wearing a hat for warmth, and took it off in the metro, when she was yelled at by a group of men and women in black chadors - the full-body cloaks worn by female morality police - to put on her headscarf.

""I didn't have one. Only my hat. And a stubborn urge in me refused to put it on,"" she says. ""It was so scary. I kept walking, ignoring them. And there were so many of them, they'd occupied most of the station.""

It was only when she heard one of them say to the other, ""Please take this girl to the van,"" that she reconsidered.

""My blood ran cold. I panicked and my dad got scared as well. So I put on my hat!""

The only other time Donya covers her head is to enter her university, because she wouldn't be allowed in without it. However, she says she - and others - then take it off in the classrooms.

""My friends and I wish we could wear cool clothes with gorgeous hairstyles at university - like in other countries.

""People were asleep before Mahsa's death - metaphorically - but now they're more aware,"" she adds.

""The protests are the reason why so many women refuse to wear a headscarf on the streets. But they're also tired of the pressure and all the news of executions. It's a difficult and exhausting path.""

But people still write graffiti on public walls, she says, and boycott state television.

""I see people fighting for change every day,"" she says. ""I believe in my generation, Gen Z. We can't stand oppression. People find every chance they can to dance and cheer or sing in the streets, because dancing is illegal.""

Azad, too, is buoyed by the solidarity of strangers, and a new sense of unity against the regime.

She says even hijab-wearing women encourage her for refusing to cover her hair. And she's convinced that, after 45 years in power, the days of the Islamic Republic are numbered.",Resume23,[],,"['ready', 'rules', 'wear', 'pay', 'iranian', 'defying', 'jail', 'caption', 'public', 'price', 'headscarf', 'hijab', 'donya', 'streets', 'women', 'arrested']",bbc_articles

Prince Harry Loses Security Legal Challenge: What Happened,"Prince Harry has lost a high court challenge against the British government regarding a 2020 decision by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) to downgrade the level of personal security he receives when visiting the U.K.

The decision meant that Harry received a lower level of taxpayer-funded protection than other royals after he and his wife Meghan Markle transitioned out of their roles as “senior members” of the royal family.

Harry’s lawyers challenged Ravec’s initial decision, arguing that it was “unlawful and unfair” and warned that a “successful attack” on Prince Harry could have an impact on the U.K.’s reputation.

Retired High Court judge Sir Peter Lane said, in heavily-redacted court documents, that Harry’s lawyers had “an inappropriate, formalist interpretation of the Ravec process” and that the decision made in 2020 was “legally sound.”

In December, when the Duke of Sussex’s claim was first heard, Home Office lawyers said that Harry could still have access to some taxpayer-funded security provisions but that these would be “bespoke arrangements” as opposed to automatically provided security detail.

Harry and his lawyers argued that this reduced level of security would make it difficult for him to ensure his and his family’s safety should they visit the U.K. Harry and Meghan share two children, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.

Harry’s legal team have said they will appeal the ruling. “The Duke is not asking for preferential treatment, but for a fair and lawful application of Ravec’s own rules, ensuring that he receives the same consideration as others in accordance with Ravec’s own written policy,” a legal spokesperson for Harry said in a statement, per the BBC.",Resume49,[],,"['ravecs', 'court', 'harry', 'happened', 'legal', 'lawyers', 'decision', 'prince', 'receives', 'challenge', 'ravec', 'level', 'taxpayerfunded', 'security', 'loses']",time_articles
France Bans ‘Steak‘ Label: How Plant-Based Products Are Regulated Worldwide,"What do you call a chunk of beef-like protein that “bleeds” beet-juice?

Not a steak, says the French government, which just issued a decree on Tuesday restricting how plant-based products can be marketed to consumers.

In recent years, plant-based mock meats—from burger patties to sausages and “chicken” nuggets—have become a mainstay on supermarket shelves, with the industry having grown to a global market size of more than $4 billion, as consumers increasingly seek to shift their diets to healthier and climate-friendlier options.

But after years of wrangling by French meat producers, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and the health and finance ministries have banned (effective in three months' time) the use of 21 terms—including “steak,” “fillet,” and “ham”—to describe meat-free products on their packaging.

Violators of the new labeling law face fines of up to €1,500 ($1,620) for individuals and €7,500 ($8,120) for companies—though producers will have a year to clear their existing inventory containing meat labels.

The move, pushed for years by the meat industry and formally proposed in September, comes as French farmers, who wield significant political influence, have been protesting for months against environmental regulations among other political grievances.

Read More: What to Know About the Farmer Protests in Europe

While the meat industry argues that marketing mock meats as meat may mislead consumers, critics say that their lobbying for label restrictions is merely an attempt to disadvantage plant-based competitors.

But the war of words is far from over: French producers of plant-based products have opposed the new label restrictions, ostensibly meant to help clear up confusion for consumers, saying that consumers can tell the difference between products labeled as “steak” versus “veggie steak,” a viewpoint the French supreme court affirmed in a December ruling. Opponents also say that the new rules, which apply only to products manufactured in France and not to imports, will only boost foreign competition in the space.

The debate over the labeling of plant-based meats was escalated to the European Court of Justice last year, but the French government has proceeded with its new regulations before the European body has given any ruling.

But it’s not just France—and it’s not just meat. Currently, across the European Union, words such as “milk,” “butter,” or “yogurt” are not allowed to be used to label plant-based dairy alternatives—even if they’re qualified with terms like “plant-based” or “vegan.”

In 2020, the E.U. rejected a proposal to ban plant-based products from using descriptors commonly associated with meat, such as “burger” and “sausage.” Policy experts who opposed the ban argued that it would deter consumers from trying out plant-based products, which would have a negative impact on the E.U.’s climate goals.

Here’s what plant-based product-labeling regulations look like in other parts of the world:

United States

There is currently no federal ban on the labeling of plant-based products with meaty descriptors. But several states have issued their own rules.

In 2018, Missouri became the first state in the U.S. to ban use of the word “meat” on products that are not actually derived from livestock or poultry. Violators are subject to a fine up to $1,000 or one year in prison. The move was lauded by farmer rights groups, saying that it reduces confusion among consumers, but was met with a lawsuit from plant-based advocates protesting the decision.

Since then, other states have followed with restrictions on using common meat and dairy terms in the labeling of plant-based products, including Oklahoma and Kansas.

Such bans have been the target of heated debate, and sometimes been repealed. In 2019, an Arkansas ban on using meat-related words for plant-based product labels was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. But a ban in Louisiana that was similarly ruled unconstitutional by a lower court was reinstated by an appellate court last April.

Last June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a bill that mandates labels for alternative meat products to include descriptors like “meatless,” “plant-based,” or “analogue”—making the state, which is the biggest beef producer in the U.S., the latest to impose naming restrictions on plant-based products.

The U.S. meat industry has for years been accused of unfairly targeting their plant-based counterparts, including running a 2020 Super Bowl commercial that insinuated health concerns about vegan meat.

Last year, the Food and Drug Administration declared that oat, soy, and almond beverages can retain the word “milk” in their packaging, ending a decadeslong debate between milk producers and makers of dairy-free alternatives.

United Kingdom

The U.K., which already bans plant-based products from describing themselves as “milk,” is considering introducing additional restrictions on labeling for more plant-based products—including bans on words that sound like dairy items such as “m*lk,” “cheeze,” and “not milk.”

In May last year, an investigative report by Greenpeace journalism team Unearthed found that the U.K. dairy industry has spent years lobbying for stricter enforcement of plant-based labeling laws.

In a recent win for the plant-based industry, however, a U.K. court ruled in December that Oatly, the popular oat beverage, will be allowed to continue using the word “milk” in its slogan “Post Milk Generation.”

Australia and New Zealand

Australia and New Zealand, which are governed by the same food regulatory framework, have also been caught in the fierce tussle between the meat industry and plant-based proponents over what to call plant-based products.

In 2021, the Australian Parliament held public consultations on the labeling of plant-based products. The following year, in the wake of complaints from farmers about the use of animal imagery and associations in plant-based product packaging, a Senate inquiry concluded with recommendations to tighten plant-based product labeling laws.

However, the recommendation was lambasted by plant-based meat advocates, many citing a study conducted by the University of Technology Sydney on local consumers that found that they were not confused over the labeling of plant-based products using descriptors associated with their meat-based counterparts.

For now, there are only voluntary guidelines on how to label meat and dairy alternative products, including suggested descriptors like “plant-based” or “dairy-free,” as well as a recommendation that depictions of animals should take up no more than 15% of the available space on the front of the packet.

Italy

In November, Italy’s lower house passed a bill to ban meat-related labeling for plant-based products, but the move sparked outcry, with critics arguing that it would instead introduce the very confusion among consumers it’s meant to prevent. The bill, which also included a proposed ban on lab-grown meat, has since been postponed.

“Everyday language like ‘steak’ and ‘salami’ help people know what to expect in terms of the taste, texture, preparation and appearance of plant-based meat products,” Francesca Gallelli, a consultant at non-profit Good Food Institute Europe told news outlet Food Navigator.

China

While there are no mandatory regulations surrounding the labeling of plant-based products in China, in 2021, the non-government industry group Chinese Institute of Food Science and Technology published the country’s first voluntary standard for plant-based meat products, which stipulates that product labels should contain words “stating that this product is distinguished from animal meat products,” such as “plant-made” or “vegetarian.”

Japan

In an attempt to standardize and support the growth of the plant-based industry, in 2021, the Japanese government introduced regulations for the labeling of plant-based products, which allow plant-based companies to use terms such as “meat,” “milk,” and “eggs” to describe their products, as long as they are accompanied by disclaimers to signal to consumers that these are different from regular dairy or meat products.

India

In 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India announced a ban on the use of words like “milk” and “cheese” for plant-based products, which was later stayed by the Delhi High Court. Today, the plant-based dairy industry in the country remains steeped in uncertainty over product labels.

Singapore

According to the Singapore Food Agency, companies selling plant-based products are allowed to label them as meat, but will have to qualify the products with terms like “mock,” “cultured,” or “plant-based,” so that consumers can make “informed decisions” when purchasing.

Canada

According to requirements outlined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, while plant-based products can be described as “meat alternative” or “plant-based meat,” their labeling must also include the word “simulated” as well as the phrases “contains no meat” or “contains no poultry.”",Resume50,[],,"['products', 'food', 'france', 'labeling', 'ban', 'milk', 'consumers', 'dairy', 'plantbased', 'label', 'steak', 'meat', 'industry', 'bans', 'worldwide', 'regulated']",time_articles
Philippines’ Marcos Floats 2025 Vote on Constitutional Reform: What to Know,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.—the son and namesake of the Philippines’ late dictator—has floated the idea of holding a national vote to amend the Southeast Asian country’s constitution at the same time as its upcoming midterm elections in 2025.

“If possible, we can have the plebiscite in the local elections to be held in May next year,” he told reporters just as he was about to depart for a state visit to Australia Wednesday. “That will be a huge deal, that will save us so much, so that’s why we’re studying it.”

Constitutional amendments, commonly referred to as “Cha-Cha” for charter change, have been a sensitive topic in the country of 110 million, especially since Marcos Sr. had amended the constitution to prolong his rule from what was then supposed to be a limit of two terms of four years each to two decades from 1965 to 1986, during which he oversaw scores of human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and rampant corruption.

A new constitution was introduced in 1987 after Marcos Sr. was ousted in a popular revolution in 1986, and it hasn’t been amended since.

But the younger Marcos, who was elected President in 2022, has recently pushed for revisions he says are necessary to accommodate greater foreign investment and help boost the development of one of Asia’s fastest growing economies. Marcos Jr. told local broadcast outlet GMA News that the Philippines’ current constitution “was not written for a globalized world.”

The Philippines has a reputation of having some of the toughest policies on foreign investment in Asia. The country’s charter limits foreign ownership across industries—with a general rule of no more than 40%. It also forbids foreign equity in mass media, as evidenced by a case lodged against news site Rappler and its founder Maria Ressa, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 for her democracy advocacy.

Lawmakers have passed several laws that would ease such restrictions and open the Philippines up to more foreign investors, though these laws have been the subject of debate for their constitutionality.

There are three ways to propose an amendment to the Philippine constitution: ¾ of Congress members from each legislative chamber can put forward an amendment; a constitutional convention, which can propose amendments, can be called by ⅔ of Congress; or a people’s initiative can be put on the ballot if at least 12% of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least 3%, support a petition. Still, any amendment proposed via any of those methods must ultimately be approved by public referendum, requiring a simple majority.

It’s not yet clear what path Marcos Jr. will pursue, though his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, has been linked to attempts to change the constitution through a people’s initiative.

President Marcos Jr.’s reform plan, however, has drawn opposition from critics, who are fearful that the moves to amend the constitution, ostensibly for economic purposes, will be used to try to extend his term limits. Currently, Presidents in the Philippines are limited to one, six-year term.

Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos Jr.’s predecessor, emerged as one of the most outspoken opponents of the plan. In a fraying of ties between the former and current President—who had joined forces in the 2022 election when Duterte’s daughter Sara ran for vice president alongside Marcos Jr.—Duterte called out Marcos Jr. in a prayer rally in January, going so far as to label him a drug addict. Duterte has since changed his tack, however, saying that he is open to constitutional amendments “as long as it does not favor the incumbent leaders or those who will be elected in the coming elections.”

Almost every administration since 1987 has considered amending some part of the Philippine constitution. Duterte unsuccessfully pushed to change the form of the government, from a unitary presidential one to a federal one wherein regional governors would be given more political and economic power. And former Philippine President Gloria Arroyo, who also wanted to decentralize the national government and empower local governments, sought to change the two-chamber Congress to a unicameral one to expedite economic reforms, but failed.

Richard Heydarian, geopolitical analyst and senior lecturer at the University of the Philippines’ Asian Center, tells TIME that it’s not clear if Marcos Jr.’s administration has any nefarious intent, but it does seem like it wants to use economic growth as “a vehicle” or “Trojan horse” for broader constitutional change. “Obviously, anyone with an ounce of understanding of international economics would tell you that, if countries like Vietnam or China, which have extremely restrictive foreign ownership and property rights, are getting so much investments, then logically…” he says, “clearly, there is a political agenda here.”",Resume51,[],,"['jr', 'constitution', 'marcos', '2025', 'local', 'know', 'constitutional', 'economic', 'president', 'vote', 'philippines', 'floats', 'foreign', 'change', 'jrs', 'reform']",time_articles
South Korea Files Criminal Complaint Against Alleged Doctors Strike Leaders,"As South Korea’s health care system reels from a doctors’ strike that has left hospitals desperately understaffed for a little over a week now, authorities have issued their first legal crackdown on alleged organizers of the collective action. On Tuesday, the health ministry lodged a criminal complaint against five doctors affiliated with the Korean Medical Association, whom authorities suspect of instigating the strike, on charges of violating medical law and obstruction of justice, local media reported.

As of Monday evening, around 9,000 trainee doctors—or 73% of South Korea’s total number of trainees—have walked off the job, while nearly 10,000 have tendered their resignations in protest of a government plan to increase the annual quota for medical students from 3,058 to 5,058 beginning in 2025. More than 13,000 current medical students across the country—making up 70% of the total—have joined the protest and filed for leaves of absence from school.

The striking doctors say they were not properly consulted about the quota expansion, which they argue will do little to address the country’s shortage of doctors in certain fields, including pediatrics, emergency medicine, and general surgery. But critics say that the doctors are merely worried the proposed quota increase would put their existing social prestige and competitive pay at risk.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said on Tuesday that the government would go ahead with the quota expansion of medical students, which remains publicly popular despite the doctor protest, adding that the state would be “failing in its constitutional duty” if it did not provide proper medical care to the public.

“This is not a matter for negotiations or compromise,” he said.

A spokesperson for the Korean Medical Association told Bloomberg that the five members targeted in the complaint, which he described as “an exercise of unfair government power,” were willing to explain their case if summoned by authorities.

Since the strike began on Feb. 20, authorities have urged doctors to return to work by Thursday, promising immunity against disciplinary consequences if the deadline is met while threatening harsh penalties for those who continue to strike, including the suspension of medical licenses and even criminal prosecution.

“Starting March, suspending licenses and initiating legal proceedings will be unavoidable for those who do not return,” Health Minister Cho Kyoo-hong said Tuesday.

Senior figures in the Korean Medical Association as well as the Korean Intern Resident Association are being investigated on potential charges including violation of medical law, police said Monday. Seoul police also said it was investigating an anonymous online post urging trainee doctors to delete patients’ data before resigning.

Meanwhile, hospitals have been tossed into chaos, forced to cancel surgeries and treatments, including for cancer patients, and reliant on nurses to take on greater responsibilities. Among emergency measures introduced by authorities, emergency rooms in military hospitals have been opened to receive public patients, while operating hours at public hospitals have been extended. Authorities have said that they are investigating reports that a woman in her 80s died of cardiac arrest after being turned away from seven hospitals amid a shortage of doctors; however, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said the woman had terminal cancer and her death did not appear to be related to the refusal by hospitals.

“How do they expect the country or patients like me to support their walkout when they’re leaving us to die?” Kim Sung-ju, the head of the Korean Cancer Patients Rights Council and a cancer patient himself told the Washington Post.

“We regret that we have to convey the voices of young doctors in this way,” the Korean Intern Resident Association said in a statement on Feb. 20, the first day of the strike. “We hope that the government will quickly reconsider its current policy and present the right policy by reflecting the voices of medical residents.”",Resume52,[],,"['hospitals', 'south', 'criminal', 'complaint', 'including', 'korea', 'leaders', 'alleged', 'korean', 'doctors', 'medical', 'association', 'authorities', 'quota', 'strike', 'files', 'patients']",time_articles
Bag Stolen on Paris Train Reportedly Contained Olympics Security Plans,"While petty thefts are not uncommon on public transport in Paris, it would seem far-fetched that a bag robbery could upend a major international sporting event. But France faced such a fear earlier this week, after a bag was reportedly stolen on a train in the nation’s capital on Monday that was initially said to have contained security plans for the Paris Olympics that’s just months away.

Broadcast network BFMTV reported that a 56-year-old engineer working in the Paris City Hall reported to police that his bag had been stolen after he had just boarded a train leaving for Creil from the Gare du Nord station in Paris, around 6:30 p.m. local time, Monday evening.

In his report to police, the engineer reportedly explained that he had placed his bag in a compartment above his seat. But as he was preparing to change trains due to a delay, he noticed his bag was gone. The bag contained the engineer’s professional computer and two USB sticks that contain “sensitive” data, according to BFMTV, namely Paris City Hall’s security plans for the Olympics, which includes the deployment of some 2,000 municipal police officers.

Police referred questions by TIME on Tuesday to the Paris prosecutor’s office, which confirmed the theft via a statement but said that the stolen technology does not contain sensitive elements but rather only “notes related to traffic during the Olympic Games.”

In an official statement released to the public on Wednesday, Paris City Hall reiterated that the internal information on the stolen technology was related to the “IT mission of the roads and travel department” and said that the victim “was not in possession of any information relating to the organization and deployment of law enforcement.” It added: “All necessary resets have been carried out to cut off all access to the City computer systems.”

Regional transport police are now investigating the crime, using CCTV footage, and, at the request of the mayor, the Paris general inspectorate is investigating the breach of internal security procedures.

The International Olympic Committee expressed confidence in January in how French authorities would keep the 2024 Olympics, which kick off on July 26, safe with an “extensive security plan.”

Fearing attacks on crowded areas during the upcoming summer games, especially after Paris was home to a string of terrorist incidents that killed at least 130 people across the city in 2015 and violent riots sparked by social and economic concerns during the last couple years, security protocols have been ramped up, including controversial plans for stringent checkpoints and the deployment of tens of thousands of security staff, both public and private.

In preparation, organizers including the French government, IOC, and partner companies allocated a budget of 320 million euros (about $350 million) for security. Some 45,000 security staff are set to be deployed on the first day—which is expected to see as many as 600,000 spectators gather in the capital to watch boats carrying athletes through the river Seine for the first Olympics opening ceremony held outside a sports stadium. After that, 35,000 security staff are set to be deployed throughout Paris during the following days of the tournament, which runs until August 11.",Resume53,[],,"['security', 'staff', 'olympics', 'public', 'deployment', 'bag', 'contained', 'stolen', 'reportedly', 'train', 'plans', 'paris', 'city']",time_articles
"South Korea’s World’s-Lowest Fertility Rate Drops to New Record, Again","South Korea set a fresh record for the world’s lowest fertility rate as the impact of the nation’s aging demographics looms large for its medical system, social welfare provision and economic growth.

The number of babies expected per woman in a lifetime fell to 0.72 last year from 0.78 in 2022, according to data released Wednesday by South Korea’s national statistics office. The number of births also slid by 7.7% to 230,000, setting a new low for comparable data in a nation of about 50 million people.

Read More: The Low-Fertility Trap: Why Some Countries May Have to Accept the New Normal

The lack of babies is speeding up the aging of South Korean society, generating concerns about the growing fiscal burden of public pensions and health care.

“From medical services to welfare, demand for spending will increase while fewer taxes will be collected as the number of young people decreases,” said Shin Seung-keun, a professor of fiscal policy at Tech University of Korea.

President Yoon Suk Yeol has run into difficulties as he tries to take action in response to the demographic challenges the nation is facing.

Yoon’s government is seeking to boost the number of medical students in a country that has one of the most acute shortages of doctors in the developed world, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Thousands of trainee doctors have handed in their resignations and walked out in protest, saying the plan doesn’t address key issues with their working conditions. That’s resulted in a standoff threatening lives ahead of parliamentary elections in April.

Read More: South Korea Hits Back at Striking Doctors With Criminal Complaint Against 5 Alleged Leaders

Doctors are pointing to the low number of births as a reason the government should scrap its plan to raise medical school intakes by about two-thirds.

Beyond the strains on the medical system, low fertility is also threatening South Korea’s economic prosperity and dynamism in the long term by shrinking its workforce and slowing consumption.

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has said that the low proportion of births is already starting to weigh on growth potential, while warning against Japan-style fiscal and monetary stimulus to combat the challenges of an aging economy.

Fewer babies also mean fewer South Korean soldiers, casting a long shadow over national security in a country that faces the threat of provocations from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s 1.2 million-strong army.

Tech University of Korea’s Shin warned against following Japan’s example of focusing on the needs of seniors. He described South Korea’s neighbor as a “silver democracy.”

“Politicians will naturally lean toward older people that are bigger in numbers, concentrating support on them and shattering a virtuous economic cycle that invests more in the education of next generations for greater productivity,” he said.

Japanese government data released this week showed the number of babies sliding to a new record low last year. Policymakers in both countries have yet to find effective measures for turning around population decline without resorting to more pro-active immigration policies.

Diverse factors are blamed for the reluctance among South Koreans to have kids. They range from skyhigh housing costs to the expensive and highly competitive environment for children’s education. Increasing gender tensions are another reason regularly highlighted.

In 2022 marriages fell to a new low. While some 192,500 couples tied the knot, that was down 42% from decade earlier, according to Statistics Korea.

When couples do get married, they fear unfavorable consequences if they take time off work to look after their children. South Korea has the smallest share of parents going on leave for children in the developed world, according to a Korea National Assembly Research Service study.

Women also find it hard to maintain job security and wages after coming back from childcare. South Korea has the highest share of late-middle-aged women with temporary jobs in the OECD, a factor that feeds into the worst gender wage gap in the developed world.

The challenge of declining populations isn’t unique to South Korea. Aging is increasing the fiscal burden in other developed countries, spurring concerns over long-term debt sustainability, reducing spending on infrastructure and eventually hurting the quality of life.

A separate report by the U.N. Population Fund showed South Korea ranked second lowest at 0.9 in fertility, just after Hong Kong at 0.8. The U.N. and Statistics Korea use different modeling methods with South Korea basing its figure on actual population statistics rather than projections.

Still, among nations with larger populations, South Korea’s population crisis is acute. A Statistics Korea forecast last year projected the population in 2072 would fall to 36.2 million, a 30% decline from the current 51 million.

Other moves by the government to address the country’s demographic challenges, include a tripling of monthly allowances for parents of newborns and a reduction of mortgage interest rates. South Korea also plans to ease regulations on hiring foreign nannies to boost the limited options available for childcare.

Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon is considering a city-sponsored matchmaking program as part of efforts to promote marriages and stem the decline in births. The city posted a fertility rate of 0.55 last year, the lowest among all regions, according to the latest data.

The government’s options include raising the retirement age, boosting automation at work and opening the door wider to immigrants, experts say.

“From Japan to Europe, aging is getting increasingly common and the key question is how we’ll address shortfalls in the working population able to support economic growth and the transition of industrial structures,” said Shin In-chol, a professor of urban sociology at the University of Seoul.

“Ultimately we have to make do with the people we already have or bring in help from elsewhere,” he said.",Resume54,[],,"['worldslowest', 'south', 'low', 'korea', 'fertility', 'number', 'economic', 'record', 'medical', 'drops', 'rate', 'statistics', 'aging', 'population', 'koreas']",time_articles
Israel Restricts Visas to Aid Groups Supporting Palestinians,"Israel has stopped renewing visas and work permits for scores of aid workers who provide vital support for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks.

Faris Arouri, director of the Association of International Development Agencies, an umbrella group, said those barred include country directors and emergency response teams, as well as senior management and other expatriates working in the West Bank or coordinating matters inside Gaza.

AIDA’s members include Oxfam, Action Against Hunger, Amnesty International, Care International and Catholic Relief Services.

Until now, Israel’s Welfare Ministry has played the key role in recommendations for such visas. But it doesn’t feel equipped to do the requisite background checks and urged the Prime Minister’s Office to designate a different agency, according to Gil Horev, a ministry spokesman.

The Prime Minister’s office said it had asked the National Security Council to figure out the best way to proceed, which may take some time.

“It’s creating a huge bottleneck for organizations,” Arouri said. “More than 60% of expatriate humanitarian workers have had their visas expire in the past few weeks because, as of Oct. 7, the Israeli authorities stopped issuing work visas.”

Israel has long accused some nongovernmental organizations of having a hostile political agenda. After the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas operatives, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped, Israel said it found evidence that United Nations workers in Gaza were Hamas activists who took part in the assault.

Israel has been attacking Hamas in Gaza for nearly five months, killing almost 30,000 there, according to the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union.

Talks are now underway for a pause in fighting and an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli media reported that talks in Paris involving representatives from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar as well as Israel made progress on Friday.

Meantime, conditions on the ground in Gaza are increasingly desperate. And in the West Bank, workers have been barred from entering Israel, leading to increased distress and greater need there as well.

Gerald Steinberg, a retired Israeli political scientist who founded NGOMonitor, a group that seeks to expose nonprofits that work against Israel, said that some of the organizations in question are anti-Israel, and that the time has come not to automatically renew their presence.

“October 7 changed the rules and Israel is not just going to give out those visas,” he said. “Many of these groups have been propagandists of Palestinian victimhood and Israeli aggression.”

Three aid workers for major international organizations said their work permits haven’t been renewed recently. As a result they’ve had to choose whether to leave Israel or stay in the country without working.

A letter on behalf of the aid groups, dated Feb. 20 and sent to Israel’s Attorney General, said that, “As of October 2023, the Ministry of Welfare suddenly and unilaterally stopped exercising its part of the procedure.”

The letter said the need for aid was urgent and added that three general managers of international organizations were recently refused access to Israel.",Resume55,[],,"['organizations', 'israeli', 'ministry', 'supporting', 'aid', 'international', 'israel', 'work', 'hamas', 'restricts', 'palestinians', 'workers', 'groups', 'visas']",time_articles
The Mental Health Toll of the War in Gaza,"Maram Nemer, a clinical psychologist who works with women and children from rural villages in the Hebron region of the West Bank, says that many of her patients have reported a peculiar symptom recently. “They complain about a funny taste in the mouth,” she tells TIME. “For one patient, it was a bitter taste and a dryness in the throat, which got worse every time she watched the news.”

Upon examining the patients, however, Nemer typically doesn’t find any physical abnormalities to suggest why they are experiencing such sensations. Instead, the doctor says the symptoms are more likely related to post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, triggered by the war in Gaza.

“It’s a physiological manifestation of the fear and anxiety caused by the war,” explains Ronit Zimmer, the CEO of Project Rozana, an international NGO working with Nemer in an all-women, multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals as part of a program called Women4Women.

Palestinians have long reported trauma from living in occupied Palestinian territories. But Israel’s latest military campaign in Gaza—launched following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people—has been called a “grim milestone.” The war’s impact is largely measured by the number of physical injuries and deaths, with 29,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of whom are women and children, killed so far. Now, experts warn that the war-related trauma endured by Palestinians presents new and acute challenges that traditional mental health frameworks are not equipped to handle.

“When the bombing finally stops, Gazans will also begin processing trauma many people on Earth cannot understand,” Yara M. Asi, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s School of Global Health Management and Informatics recently wrote in the New York Times. “Where do we begin to bring people back from a state of mental anguish where the thought of a quick death is seen as a glimmer of mercy?”

A breakdown in defense mechanisms

Although Women4Women doesn’t work with patients in the besieged strip of Gaza, the clinicians say the impact of the war has reverberated through the West Bank. The program, which gives free healthcare to women and children through mobile health clinics, has seen a massive surge in patients since October—from 500 to 2,000 every month—which Zimmer attributes to added security checkpoints and road closures, as well as the loss of jobs in the occupied territories, which has rendered Palestinians unable to travel or pay for healthcare. As a result, “our team has been working over[time] hours and spending a lot of time just trying to get to the community,” she says.

“When we go to the villages in Hebron, many patients say they feel guilty because they can still have food and water while people in Gaza don’t,” says the program’s coordinator Amany Abu Asabeh through her translator, director Diana Shehade Nama.

There is also a “constant state of fear” over the threat of the war reaching the West Bank. The heavy military presence, along with a lack of control, is “impeding any joy of life, as well as the most basic right to get treatment,” says Abu Asabeh. As a result, the patients report feeling constant anxiety, overthinking, and insomnia which will physically manifest through sensations like “jitters, weird smells and tastes, and a complete lack of energy.”

Mothers who have confided in Nemer report their kids constantly asking to watch the news or role-playing the war by forming gangs and fighting in schools. “In other instances, the mothers relayed that their kids have been having nightmares for a very prolonged period, where they dream of soldiers coming inside and ransacking the home,” says Nemer.

Some patients even exhibit types of behavior that would fit the characteristics of clinical obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, says Abed Alkareem Asherah, another clinical psychologist working with the program. “They are paranoid about getting attacked, or before they go to bed, they will repeatedly check to make sure their doors and windows are closed shut.”

Asherah adds that such symptoms and conditions usually appear when patients experience a breakdown in their defense mechanism after being triggered by traumatic events. Eventually, a physical examination reveals that “a lot of the complaints are psychological wounds that require carefully planned and executed mental health interventions,” says Zimmer.

A long and cumulative history of trauma

Palestinians have long undergone an acute mental health crisis due to the history of violent conflict with Israel. A study conducted by the World Bank in November 2022 found that more than half of the adult Palestinian population screened positive for depression, including 71% of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and 58% in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A smaller number showed signs of PTSD, a mental illness that usually develops after one experiences traumatic events, first recognized in war veterans as “shell shock.”

The World Bank billed the study as a pioneering effort to determine the effects of “overlapping vulnerabilities and cumulative traumas on the Palestinian population” on mental health due to “decades of exposure to conflict, restrictions on movements, and poor living conditions,” particularly in Gaza.

Other studies have reported similar outcomes: A 2020 study found that nearly 54% of participants, made up of students in Gaza aged 11 to 17, fit the diagnosis criteria for PTSD. Another study conducted across the West Bank and Gaza found that 100 percent of participants had been exposed to traumas in 2021, including events as varied as land confiscation, detention, home demolition, loss of loved ones, and fear of losing one’s life.

But nowhere is the impact of worsening mental health more apparent than among Palestinian children. Before the war, more than 500,000 children required mental health and psychosocial support in the Gaza Strip, according to UNICEF. It is estimated that the number has risen to more than a million.

For many children, the loss of family members has exacerbated the trauma by stripping away a support mechanism that would help them cope with the conflict. Last November, medical NGOs like Doctors without Borders shared that the number of child patients in Gaza without any surviving family members was so high that a new acronym, “WCNSF” (Wounded Child No Surviving Family), was coined to identify them.

“Time and time again, we’ve warned that the toll of conflict and the blockade on children’s mental health is too great. Even before this escalation, more than half of parents we spoke to reported that their children were self-harming or experiencing suicidal thoughts,” stated Jason Lee, Save the Children’s Country Director for the occupied Palestinian territory.

“We are running out of words to raise the alarm in strong enough terms or to articulate the scale of children’s suffering,” he continued.

Inadequate tools for treatment

As the mental health crisis worsens, some experts like Yara M. Asi say that the existing tools and frameworks used to screen for PTSD and trauma may not be adequate for what’s currently happening in Gaza—where mental health care is already underfunded, and for which current humanitarian aid lacks resources. Even the current mental health terminology and accompanying treatments may not be suitable for what they're seeing on the ground due to the differences in the cultural experience of processing trauma.

On the ground level, interventions like the ongoing Brothers at Heart project, which provides immediate mental health care through therapy, as well as UNICEF’s space for children to engage in psychosocial support, have been lauded. “By introducing both local and foreign interventions, Gazan youth can have a clear path toward improved mental health. These endeavors are not just humanitarian imperatives but crucial investments in the future stability and prosperity of the region,” experts write in the medical journal, the Lancet.

But in the absence of any nuance in current mental healthcare as the war in Gaza continues, Nemer, the psychologist in Hebron, can only diagnose and treat patients with the limited resources at her disposal. “Usually, I’ll give them a checklist of steps they can follow to help manage their stress and anxiety,” she says. “I’ll also remind them that we don't know when this war is going to end, so all they can do is focus on what they can control to maintain their energy, both physically and mentally.”",Resume56,[],,"['mental', 'health', 'toll', 'bank', 'war', 'west', 'palestinian', 'gaza', 'patients', 'trauma', 'children']",time_articles
Alibaba Leads Record Deal to Mint $2.5 Billion China AI Firm,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led the largest single financing round for a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, the latest in a string of sizable investments that suggest the e-commerce firm is again deploying capital in the hunt for growth.

Alibaba joins Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI, the technology that powers ChatGPT. It led a $1 billion funding round in Moonshot AI with existing backer Monolith Management, boosting the year-old firm’s valuation eight-fold to some $2.5 billion, people familiar with the deal said. They joined previous backers including food delivery giant Meituan’s investment arm Long-Z and Hongshan, formerly Sequoia China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private transaction.

Founded in March 2023, Moonshot AI is among the better-known startups developing generative artificial intelligence in China, hoping to eventually match the likes of OpenAI and Google. It rolled out its Kimi chatbot to the public last November and has since launched a platform for developers to build AI applications atop its model. Its valuation stood at just $300 million when it secured initial funding.

Moonshot AI declined to comment on the company’s fundraising details, which were first reported by local media including 36kr. Monolith confirmed its participation in the latest round, without details. Alibaba representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Alibaba’s new chiefs, Joseph Tsai and Eddie Wu, have pledged to turn around a flagging company hammered by two years of regulatory scrutiny and an economic downturn. It’s driving new investment into game-changing technologies such as AI, while orchestrating a complicated multi-way split that will bring business lines from cloud to logistics to the fore. Tsai has said the cloud unit now hosts half of China’s generative AI firms and serves about 80% of the country’s technology companies.

But they’re getting into a field that’s getting crowded, as venture capital firms and tech leaders pour billions into training and developing AI services, mirroring a wave of activity across Silicon Valley and Europe. Other Chinese AI startups raising significant amounts from investors included Baichuan and Zhipu.

That’s despite lingering concerns about U.S. sanctions, which bar Chinese firms from buying the most powerful Nvidia Corp. chips used to train and run AI models. Washington has targeted China’s AI efforts because the technology has geopolitical and military applications, complicating an already tense relationship.

Alibaba previously joined a $300 million-plus round for Zhipu in 2023 alongside longtime rival Tencent.

Russia Jails Oleg Orlov for Ukraine War Criticism,"A Moscow court sentenced human rights activist Oleg Orlov to two and a half years in prison for denouncing the war in Ukraine.

Orlov, 70, was accused by prosecutors for “discrediting” the Russian army in an op-ed for French media where he said that “mass murder” was taking place in Ukraine. “Who is to blame for Russia going fascist? The simplest answer is Putin. He is to blame, of course,” he wrote.

Russia passed new censorship laws following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that made “discrediting” Russia’s military a criminal offense.

Orlov is most known for his work as the co-chair of Memorial, which was set up in 1989 to document human rights abuses during the Soviet era. In October 2022, Memorial was one of three laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Russian prosecutors claimed that Orlov’s article had “a motive of enmity and hatred toward military personnel.” Orlov told the court in his closing statement that he rejected the charges against him. “I don’t regret anything and I don’t repent anything,” he said.

“Today’s sentencing of Orlov is the result of a sham trial enacted by the Russian authorities to punish a prominent state critic and instill fear among those who dare to speak up against the war in Ukraine,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

Russian authorities have cracked down on dissent since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since 2022, tens of thousands of people have been penalized by authorities for expressing anti-war views.

Earlier this month, Alexei Navalny, Russia’s main opposition leader who was jailed in 2021, died in a Russian penal colony in the Arctic circle. U.S. President Joe Biden said that the exact cause of his death is unknown, “but there is no doubt that the death of Navalny was a consequence of something Putin and his thugs did.”",Resume58,[],,"['orlov', 'rights', 'russian', 'navalny', 'oleg', 'prosecutors', 'russia', 'jails', 'criticism', 'ukraine', 'war', 'authorities', 'putin', 'russias']",time_articles
Biden Discusses Gaza Ceasefire While Eating Ice Cream,"U.S. President Joe Biden is facing criticism after he weighed in on the Israel-Hamas war while holding an ice cream cone near his mouth.

Biden visited Van Leeuwen’s ice cream shop in New York City after filming an appearance for Late Night With Seth Meyers on Monday. In videos that emerged of the appearance, Biden was seen ordering mint chip ice cream and talking to other customers, before answering questions from reporters about when a ceasefire was possible.

“I hope by… the end of the weekend,” Biden answered. “My national security advisor tells me we’re close. We’re close. It’s not done yet. My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire,” Biden said.

Critics blasted the optics and timing of Biden’s comments.

“This appears both irresponsible, and with the ice cream cone, tone deaf and tactless,” Mairav Zonszein, an Israeli-American journalist and commentator, wrote on social media platform X.

“Nothing says ‘we're taking this seriously’ like talking about a war that has killed ~30,000 people with an ice-cream cone halfway to your mouth,” Gregg Carlstrom, the Economist’s Middle East correspondent, said on X.

The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has reached at least 29,782, according to Gazan health authorities. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed during the Hamas Oct. 7 attacks.

“Biden makes impotent gestures in the general direction of geopolitical affairs that illustrate only his lack of control over them while eating an ice cream cone. This man owns his brand,” journalist Noah Rothman said on X.

Biden’s comments come amid reports of progress in indirect talks involving Israel and Hamas. A deal would reportedly involve aid deliveries to Gaza and the release of more Israeli hostages. But Israel has not commented on the talks and Hamas officials have suggested a deal is farther away than Biden’s remarks suggest, the BBC reported.

Others have focused on the political timing of Biden’s comments. “Biden drops the ceasefire-by-next Monday teaser on what just happens to be the eve of the Michigan primary, where he's in such trouble with Muslim voters,” Canadian broadcaster Richard Gizbert posted on X.

Michigan, a battleground state, is home to the largest Arab American community in the U.S. and the state heads to the polls for Tuesday’s primary.

The Biden Administration’s approach to Gaza has spurred a major drop in support among Arab Americans, according to an October poll by the Arab American Institute.

The New Antisemitism,"Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, is the author of the new book To Be a Jew Today: A New Guide to God, Israel, and the Jewish People

Why won’t antisemitism die, or at least die down? In the months following Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, antisemitic incidents increased substantially. The Anti-Defamation League, which keeps track, says they tripled in the U.S. over the previous year, although its criteria also changed to include anti-Zionism. But from 2019 to 2022, the amount of people with highly antisemitic attitudes in the U.S. had nearly doubled, the ADL found. In Europe, Human Rights Watch warned in 2019 of an “alarming” rise in antisemitism, prompting the European Union to adopt a strategic plan for fighting it two years later.

No one can say definitively why the pre–Gaza War surge happened when it did. The salience of groups like the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 probably played a role, as did the influence of figures like the troubled rapper turned designer Kanye West. Historically, antisemitism has been a side effect of populism, which traffics in us-vs.-them stereotypes. Social media allows antisemitic influencers to recruit and communicate directly to followers, getting around the filtering bottleneck of the legacy media. The murder of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, by a shooter enraged at Jewish groups providing aid to immigrants, was the painful lowlight of this era.

It can be hard to think clearly and reason calmly about antisemitism. For 15 million Jews around the world, its resilience engenders fear, pain, sadness, frustration, and intergenerational trauma going back to the Holocaust and beyond. The superficial sense of security that many Jews feel on a daily basis in the contemporary world turns out to be paper-thin. Jews know enough of their own familial stories to realize that in historical terms, such moments of safety have often been fleeting, followed by renewed persecution. Sitting in my office in leafy Cambridge, Mass., a proud citizen of the freest country in the world, in which Jews have been safer than in any other country in history, I am not free of emotion on the topic. Nor could I be.

For many non-Jews, antisemitism matters deeply too. People everywhere who believe that all humans are created equal know that the presence of antisemitism in a society has often been the forerunner of other visceral, irrational hatreds, from racism to homophobia to Islamophobia. Worse, the persistence of antisemitism stands as a stubborn counterargument to Martin Luther King Jr.’s hopeful faith that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.

In the past, antisemites, whether medieval Crusaders or 20th century Nazis, were often proud of their views. Today, thankfully, almost no one wants to be accused of antisemitism.

That’s a marker of human progress. It also means that the whole subject of antisemitism needs to be approached with charity and sensitivity. People who harbor no conscious negative ideas about Jews may unknowingly hold views that resonate with historical antisemitism.

Jews aren’t exempt from this, and so, neither am I. In a world roiled by polarizing debate, my aim is to encourage introspection—to get you to ask, as I ask myself, whether your feelings and beliefs would be the same if seen through the lens of the history and context of antisemitism. I come not to accuse anyone of antisemitism, but to explore the topic in a way that deepens our understanding of where it comes from, and where it’s going.

The easiest way to explain why antisemitism is still with us is to blame religion. Scholars agree that what we call antisemitism today has its historical origins in a strain of anti-Jewish thought that grew out of early Christianity. The Gospels describe the Jews as complicit in the Roman crucifixion of Jesus. Paul’s theology was read to depict the Jews as having been replaced or superseded as God’s special favorites by the community of Christian believers. By failing to become Christians, Jews implicitly challenged the narrative of inevitable Christian triumph. For well over a thousand years, Jews in Christian Europe were subject to systemic, institutionalized oppression. Historical antisemitism took the form of discrimination, expulsion, and massacre.

The problem with blaming religion is that antisemitism today is no longer driven primarily by Christianity. Although antisemitism can still be found among Christians, in the U.S. and around the world, most contemporary believing Christians are not antisemites. The old theological condemnation of the Jews for killing Christ has been repudiated by nearly every Christian denomination.

Nor does antisemitism among Muslims primarily reflect the classical Islamic claims made against the Jews, such as the accusation that the Jews (and Christians) distorted Scripture, resulting in discrepancies between the Bible and the Koran. Jews in Muslim lands mostly fared better than in Christian Europe. Until the 20th century, those Jews occupied a complex, second-class status, protected alongside Christians as “people of the book” and also simultaneously subject to special taxes and social subordination. The tropes of modern Europe’s antisemitism—of Jews’ power and avarice—mostly came to the Middle East late, through Nazi influence. Even the prevalence of antisemitism among Islamist groups like Hamas isn’t primarily driven by religion. Rather, it is part of their politically motivated effort to turn a struggle between two national groups for the same piece of land into a holy war.

It emerges that far from being an unchanging set of ideas derived from ancient faiths, antisemitism is actually a shape-shifting, protean, creative force. Antisemitism has managed to reinvent itself multiple times throughout history, each time keeping some of the old tropes around, while simultaneously creating new ones adapted to present circumstances.

In each iteration, antisemitism reflects the ideological preoccupations of the moment. In antisemitic discourse, Jews are always made to exemplify what a given group of people considers to be the worst feature of the social order in which they live.

A crucial reason why is surely that Jews were the most salient minority group living among Christians for the bulk of European history—and Europe was the heartland of historical antisemitism. The practice of projecting immediate social fears and hatreds onto Jews grew from the human need to treat some nearby group of people as the Other. (Muslims and Asians eventually also became subject to projection and fantasy, a practice dubbed Orientalism by the literary scholar Edward Said.) Once Jews had become the go-to targets for exemplifying societal ills, the habit stuck.

In this way, crucially, antisemitism is not and has never been about actual Jews so much as antisemites’ imagination of them. Because antisemitic ideology isn’t accountable to real-life facts, its content can be altered and changed as a society’s worries and moral judgments shift. Antisemitism’s capacity to keep its familiar character while also channeling new fears is what confers its stunning capacity to reinvent itself.

The first major reinvention of antisemitism took place as the Enlightenment gradually reduced the role of religion as the main source of Europeans’ attitudes and beliefs. Nineteenth century antisemitism preserved the old belief that the Jews were unique, having once been God’s chosen people and then uniquely punished for rejecting Christ. But it transformed this uniqueness to match the concerns of contemporary society.

Preoccupied with economic and social upheaval, antisemites depicted Jews as both uniquely capitalist and uniquely communist. Concerned about an unstable global power balance, antisemites claimed that Jews secretly controlled the world. Entranced by the pseudoscience of race that flourished after Darwin, antisemites declared that Jews were racially inferior. The obvious contradictions—that far from running the world, most Jews were impoverished, or that capitalism and communism were warring ideologies—did not deter antisemites. They ignored the illogic, or fell back on conspiracy theory, like the myth that Jewish capitalists and Jewish communists were secretly in cahoots. Ultimately, in different ways, both Nazism and Marxism identified Jews as an enemy deserving liquidation. The virulent antisemitism that fueled the Holocaust was thus partly a descendant of Christian antisemitism and also the product of modern conditions.

Today, racial pseudoscience is an embarrassment and the struggle between capitalism and communism has become passé. Antielitist populism can still draw on old canards about Jewish power, and those still resonate with certain audiences, especially on the far right. But the most perniciously creative current in contemporary antisemitic thought is more likely to come from the left.

Instead of disappearing among people who would condemn neo-Nazis, antisemitism is morphing again, right now, before our very eyes.

The core of this new antisemitism lies in the idea that Jews are not a historically oppressed people seeking self-preservation but instead oppressors: imperialists, colonialists, and even white supremacists. This view preserves vestiges of the trope that Jews exercise vast power. It creatively updates that narrative to contemporary circumstances and current cultural preoccupations with the nature of power and injustice.

Concerns about power and justice are, in themselves, perfectly legitimate, much like past concerns about the effects of unfettered capitalism on working people—or for that matter, condemnations of elitism. So it is important to distinguish carefully between critiques of power that deserve serious consideration and the antisemitic ways in which those critiques may be deployed.

That caution is especially important because Israel, the first Jewish state to exist in two millennia, plays a central role in the narrative of the new antisemitism. Israel is not an imaginary conspiracy but a real country with real citizens, a real history, a real military, and real political and social problems that concern relations between Jews and Palestinians. It is not inherently antisemitic to criticize Israel. Its power, like any national power, may be subject to legitimate, fair criticism.

It is also essential not to tar all critics of Israel with the brush of antisemitism, especially in wartime, when Israel, like any other war-waging power, is properly subject to the strictures of international humanitarian law. To deploy the charge of antisemitism for political reasons is morally wrong, undermining the horror of antisemitism itself. It is also likely to backfire, convincing critics of Israel that they are being unfairly silenced.

At the same time, Israel’s history and current situation confound categories that are so often used today to make moral judgments—categories like imperialism, colonialism, and white supremacy. And because people’s ideas about Israel typically draw on older, pre-Israel ideas about Jews, criticism of Israel can borrow, often unconsciously, from older antisemitic myths.

To understand the complicated, subtle character of the new antisemitism, notice that the concept of imperialism was developed to describe European powers that conquered, controlled, and exploited vast territories in the Global South and East. The theory of settler-colonial white supremacy was developed as a critical account of countries like Australia and the U.S., in which, according to the theory, the colonialists’ aim was to displace the local population, not to extract value from its labor. The application of these categories to Israel is a secondary development.

These borrowed categories do not fit Israel’s specificity very well. Israel is a regional Middle Eastern power with a tiny footprint, not a global or continental empire designed to extract resources and labor. It was brought into existence by a 1947 United Nations resolution that would have created two states side by side, one Jewish and one Palestinian. Its purpose, as conceived by the U.N.’s member countries, was to house displaced Jews after 6 million were killed in the Holocaust.

The Palestinian catastrophe, or nakba, of 1948 was that when the Arab invasion of Israel failed to destroy the nascent Jewish state, many Palestinians who had fled or been forced out of their homes by Israeli troops were unable to return. Those Palestinians became permanent refugees in neighboring countries. Instead of ending up in an independent Palestine as proposed by the U.N., those who had stayed in their homes found themselves living either in Israel or under Egyptian and Jordanian rule. Then, in the 1967 war, the West Bank and Gaza were conquered by Israel. Palestinians in those places came under what Israel itself defines as an occupation. They have lived in that precarious legal status ever since despite the 1993–2001 peace process.

Notwithstanding undeniable Jewish prejudice and discrimination against Arabs in Israel, the paradigm of white supremacy also does not correspond easily to the Jews. Around half of Israel’s Jewish citizens descend from European Jews, as do most American Jews. But those Jews were not considered racially white in Europe, which is one reason they had to emigrate or be killed. Roughly half of Israel’s Jews descend from Mizrahi, (literally, Eastern) origins. They are not ethnically European in any sense, much less racially “white.” A meaningful number of Israeli Jews are of Ethiopian origin, and the small community of Black Hebrew Israelites in Israel are ethnically African American.

Whether early Zionist settlers should be conceived as colonialists is a hotly disputed question. Were they stateless, oppressed people seeking refuge in their ancient homeland, where some Jews had always lived? That is certainly how they saw themselves. Or were early Zionists agents of the very European states they were seeking to flee, aiming to buy as much territory in Palestine as they could to create their own state? That is the view of critics, who emphasize the 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which Britain, still very much an empire, announced that it looked “with favor” on the creation of a national Jewish home in Palestine.

The upshot is that while a well-meaning person, free of antisemitism, could describe Israel as colonialist, the narrative of Israel as a settler-colonial oppressor on par with or worse than the U.S., Canada, and Australia is fundamentally misleading. Those who advance it run the risk of perpetuating antisemitism by condemning the Jewish state despite its basic differences from these other global examples—most important, Israel’s status as the only homeland for a historically oppressed people who have nowhere else to call their own.

To emphasize the narrative of Jews as oppressors, the new antisemitism must also somehow sidestep not only two millennia of Jewish oppression, but also the Holocaust, the largest organized, institutionalized murder of any ethnic group in human history. On the right, antisemites either deny the Holocaust ever happened or claim its scope has been overstated. On the left, one line is that Jews are weaponizing the Holocaust to legitimize the oppression of Palestinians.

During the Gaza War, some have argued that Israel, having suffered the trauma of the Holocaust, is now itself perpetrating a genocide against the Palestinian people. Like other criticisms of Israel, the accusation of genocide isn’t inherently antisemitic. Yet the genocide charge is especially prone to veering into antisemitism because the Holocaust is the archetypal example of the crime of genocide. Genocide was recognized as a crime by the international community after the Holocaust. Accusing Israel of genocide can function, intentionally or otherwise, as a way of erasing the memory of the Holocaust and transforming Jews from victims into oppressors.

It is, of course, logically possible for an oppressed group to become oppressors over time. Allegations of genocide have been brought against Israel by South Africa in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), charges Israel has wisely chosen to contest rather than ignore. The charges are based on the numbers of civilians killed, the tactics that led to the deaths, and statements by Israeli officials. This evidence is supposed to prove Israel intends to destroy the Palestinian people, in whole or in part, which is the legal definition of genocide.

The number of Palestinian dead, over 29,000 as of this writing, is heartbreaking. The rhetoric of some individual Israeli government officials cited by South Africa is particularly appalling, both in its dehumanizing character and in referring to Palestinians as Amalekites, a group whom the God of the Bible called on the ancient Israelites to “erase.” Retired Israeli Chief Justice Aharon Barak, who serves on the ICJ panel considering the genocide charges, joined a part of the court’s provisional measures that directed Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent ... public incitement to commit genocide” in Gaza.

The U.S. government has itself condemned far-right members of Israel’s Cabinet who called for Gazans to be pushed into Egypt. The repugnant policy of ethnic cleansing urged by the extremists would violate international law, even if it would arguably not count as genocide under the legal meaning of the term.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, Israel’s efforts to defend itself against Hamas, even if found to involve killing disproportionate number of civilians, do not turn Israel into a genocidal actor comparable to the Nazis or the Hutu regime in Rwanda. The genocide charge depends on intent. And Israel, as a state, is not fighting the Gaza War with the intent to destroy the Palestinian people.

Israel’s stated war aims are to hold Hamas accountable for the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and to get back its citizens who are still being held captive. These aims are lawful in themselves.

The means Israel has used are subject to legitimate criticism for killing too many civilians as collateral damage. But Israel’s military campaign has been conducted pursuant to Israel’s interpretation of the international laws of war. There is no single, definitive international-law answer to the question of how much collateral damage renders a strike disproportionate to its concrete military objective. Israel’s approach resembles campaigns fought by the U.S. and its coalition partners in Iraq in Afghanistan, and by the international coalition in the battle against ISIS for control of Mosul. Even if the numbers of civilian deaths from the air seem to be higher, it is important to recognize that Israel is also confronting miles of tunnels intentionally connected to civilian facilities by Hamas.

To be clear: as a matter of human worth, a child who dies at the hands of a genocidal murderer is no different from one who dies as collateral damage in a lawful attack. The child is equally innocent, and the parents’ sorrow equally profound. As a matter of international law, however, the difference is decisive. During the Hamas attack, terrorists intentionally murdered children and raped women. Its charter calls for the destruction of the Jewish state. Yet the accusation of genocide is being made against Israel.

These relevant facts matter for putting the genocide charge into the context of potential antisemitism. Neither South Africa nor other states have brought a genocide case against China for its conduct in Tibet or Xinjiang, or against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. There is something specifically noteworthy about leveling the charge at the Jewish state—something intertwined with the new narrative of the Jews as archetypal oppressors rather than archetypal victims. Call it the genocide sleight of hand: if the Jews are depicted as genocidal—if Israel becomes the very archetype of a genocidal state—then Jews are much less likely to be conceived as a historically oppressed people engaged in self-defense.

The new narrative of Jews as oppressors is, in the end, far too close for comfort to the antisemitic tradition of singling out Jews as uniquely deserving of condemnation and punishment, whether in its old religious form or its Nazi iteration. Like those earlier forms of antisemitism, the new kind is not ultimately about the Jews, but about the human impulse to point the finger at someone who can be made to carry the weight of our social ills. Oppression is real. Power can be exercised without justice. Israel should not be immune from criticism when it acts wrongfully. Yet the horrific history and undefeated resilience of antisemitism mean that modes of rhetorical attack on Israel and on Jews should be subject to careful scrutiny.

Just because antisemitism is a cyclical, recurring phenomenon does not mean that it is inevitable nor that it cannot be ameliorated. Like any form of irrational hate, antisemitism can in principle be overcome. The best way to start climbing out of the abyss of antisemitism is to self-examine our impulses, our stories about power and injustice, and our beliefs.

Peru Declares Health Emergency as Dengue Cases Soar,"LIMA, Peru — Peru declared a health emergency in most of its provinces on Monday due to a growing number of dengue cases that are occurring at a time of higher than usual temperatures caused by the El Nino weather pattern.

According to the nation’s health ministry, the number of dengue cases registered during the first seven weeks of this year is twice as high as during the same period in 2023 – with more than 31,000 cases recorded.

“This is a grave problem,” health minister Cesar Vásquez said last week, before the emergency was declared. “And it is getting out of hand.”

The health emergency will enable the nation’s government to transfer funds faster to the affected regions and also transport doctors and nurses. It will cover 20 of the country’s 24 provinces, including regions that surround the capital city of Lima.

A dengue epidemic last year put Peru's public health system under strain as thousands sought care in emergency rooms.

The disease is spread by Aedys Egypti, a mosquito that reproduces in hot and humid conditions.

Although most dengue cases present light symptoms, the disease can cause severe headaches, fevers and muscle pains.

Last year, a dengue epidemic in Peru killed 18 people, while in the first two months of this year 32 Peruvians have died from the virus.

In December, the World Health Organization said that Peru's 2023 dengue epidemic was linked to rains and hot temperatures that helped mosquito populations to grow, especially in the north of the country.",Resume61,[],,"['provinces', 'regions', 'dengue', 'soar', 'cases', 'health', 'emergency', 'temperatures', 'perus', 'peru', 'declares', 'epidemic']",time_articles
Artists Petition to Exclude Israel From Venice Biennale,"The Venice Biennale, often dubbed the “Olympics of the art world” for its long tradition of showcasing talent from across the globe, opens its 60th International Art Exhibition on April 20—but not without controversy: more than 8,700 artists and cultural workers have demanded that Israel be excluded from taking part in the world’s biggest art event over its deadly bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

The group, which goes by the Art Not Genocide Alliance (ANGA), published an open letter on Monday against Israel’s participation at the Biennale. It includes signatories who have participated in past Biennales or are slated to participate in the current one.

“Any official representation of Israel on the international cultural stage is an endorsement of its policies and of the genocide in Gaza,” the petition states. “The Biennale is platforming a genocidal apartheid state.”

Israel has a national pavilion in the Giardini, the parkland where the biennial art festival is held, as do 28 other countries.

The petition alleges a “double standard” when it comes to Israel’s permitted participation at the Biennale, pointing to how the organization sidelined South Africa during its apartheid regime as well as Russia in 2022 after its invasion of Ukraine.

The Biennale did not immediately respond to questions about the petition from TIME.

Israel will be represented at the Venice Biennale by artist Ruth Patir, and her exhibition will be curated by Mira Lapidot and Tamar Margalit. In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks from Hamas and the Israeli onslaught that followed, Patir and the curators told ARTnews in a statement that they thought of how to “move forward” following the “initial state of shock and despair that left us paralyzed.” They added that “there has to be a pocket for art, for free expression and creation, amidst everything that’s happening. This is the very thing that gives us hope these days. It’s also the very humanist values that we are fighting for; otherwise, we might as well contend that the extremists have won.”

But the ANGA petitioners disagreed, calling the statement “simplistic” and insisting, “Art does not happen in a vacuum.”

“While the Israeli pavilion presses ahead, the genocidal death toll in Gaza and the West Bank increases daily,” the petition read. “While Israel’s curatorial team plans their ‘Fertility Pavilion’ reflecting on contemporary motherhood, Israel has murdered more than 12,000 children and destroyed access to reproductive care and medical facilities.” (Latest figures from the Hamas-led Gaza Ministry of Health estimate some 30,000 people have died in the Palestinian enclave since Oct. 7.)

The theme of this year’s Biennale is “Foreigners Everywhere.” Curator Adriano Pedrosa says that the backdrop for this year’s exhibit is “a world rife with multiple crises concerning the movement and existence of people across countries, nations, territories and borders, which reflect the perils and pitfalls of language, translation and ethnicity, expressing differences and disparities conditioned by identity, nationality, race, gender, sexuality, wealth, and freedom.”

Palestinians have no national pavilion, but they are represented in the Biennale’s official collateral events this year by a project from a collective co-founded by Hebron-based Palestinian activist Issa Amro and Berlin-based South African photographer Adam Broomberg—who is also a signatory of the petition.



Meanwhile, another exhibition was put forward by the Connecticut-based Palestine Museum U.S., which would feature the work of 24 Palestinian artists. Biennale rejected its proposal to be an official collateral event, but the show will be displayed simultaneously as an unofficial collateral exhibit hosted by Venice’s Palazzo Mora.",Resume62,[],,"['artists', 'pavilion', 'exclude', 'art', 'israel', 'israels', 'official', 'biennale', 'venice', 'israeli', 'palestinian', 'gaza', 'petition']",time_articles
DPRK and Russia Accelerate Exchange of Weapons and Resources,"North Korea has shipped containers that could hold millions of artillery shells to Russia, a top South Korean official said, allowing President Vladimir Putin to maintain his assault on Ukraine as Kyiv’s stocks of ammunition dwindle.

South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik told reporters that North Korea is estimated to have sent about 6,700 containers to Russia, accelerating the pace of shipments since Putin held a summit with Kim Jong Un in September, Yonhap News reported Tuesday. The containers could hold about 3 million rounds of 152 mm shells, Shin said.

Russia in return is providing North Korea with food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, Shin said. The food aid has helped Kim stabilize prices for necessities, he said, adding if the arms transfers grow, Russia is set to send more military technology to Kim, which could increase Pyongyang’s ability to threaten the region.

As North Korea-Russia trade picks up with the invasion now in its third year, the flow of U.S. military aid to Kyiv has been increasingly under threat. On top of this, the European Union has sent only about 30% of the total 1 million artillery shells it pledged to give Kyiv by March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week.

The Ukrainian leader said his country believes North Korea has transferred 1.5 million artillery shells to Russia and an unknown number of missiles, adding that Pyongyang is poised to continue providing weapons.

While North Korea and Russia deny any arms transfers, imagery from commercial satellites has shown about four cargo vessels shuttling between North Korea’s Najin port near the Russian border and the Russian port of Dunay, a former Soviet submarine port about 180 kilometers (110 miles) away. The White House said it has tracked some of those shipments as they traveled by rail across Russia to be stored in depots in Russia near Ukraine.

Cold War partners Russia and North Korea have forged a new partnership since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion, built upon Pyongyang holding some of the world’s largest stocks of munitions that are interoperable with the weapons Moscow has deployed to the battlefield in Ukraine.

Pyongyang’s transfer of ballistic missiles, artillery shells and other military equipment to sustain Putin’s aggression in Ukraine is providing a jolt to an economy long isolated by international sanctions. This will allow Kim to shun engagement with the U.S. for years to come, while at the same time enhancing his ability to deploy spy satellites and develop his nuclear arms program.

North Korea’s yearly economy is about $25 billion, according to estimates from South Korea’s central bank, and the country is in desperate need of food, oil, building materials and hard cash for international commerce. The weapons Kim is providing Russia are likely worth several billion dollars and the support he is receiving from Putin likely represents some of the biggest gains Kim has seen since he took power about a dozen years ago.

Putin has shown his appreciation, giving the North Korean leader a new Russian-made automobile. The vehicle was an Aurus limousine, similar to the one Putin showed Kim when they met in September in Russia for a trip that deepened their military cooperation.",Resume63,[],,"['dprk', 'shells', 'kim', 'korea', 'north', 'weapons', 'russia', 'resources', 'accelerate', 'artillery', 'military', 'putin', 'exchange', 'providing']",time_articles
Bodies Found of Australian Couple Shot Dead by Ex-Lover Policeman,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian police on Tuesday found the bodies of a couple shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend, who happened to be a police officer, hours after he admitted to killing and hiding them under rocks and debris on a rural property.

The remains of former television reporter Jesse Baird, 26, and his flight attendant partner Luke Davies, 29, were found in the same surfboard bags that police allege the killer used to carry the bodies from Baird’s Sydney home last week, New South Wales Police Force Detective Superintendent Daniel Doherty said.

The bodies were found at a property near Bungonia, a town 200 kilometers (124 miles) southwest of Sydney, only 20 minutes drive from another property where police divers had spent days scouring waterways.

Senior-Constable Beau Lamarre-Condon, who dated Baird until late last year, was arrested Friday and charged with murdering the couple, but he had previously refused to answer police questions. The breakthrough came when he spoke to detectives on Tuesday and told them where to look.

Police suspected Lamarre-Condon first dumped the bodies last week at a property that officers later searched. But fearing that a traveling companion might reveal where they went, he returned alone on Feb. 22 to move the bodies. Police say the acquaintance, who has not been named, was unaware they were transporting bodies and was not an accomplice.

Detective Sergeant Sasha Pinazza, who is in charge of the investigation, said the search ended Monday without finding any clue to the bodies' location.

“I am exhausted. I barely have eaten or slept. We went home last night extremely deflated, but it’s not in our nature to give up,” Pinazza told reporters. She said they rallied again the day after and were able to find the remains.

The allegation that a police officer committed murder using his service pistol has shocked the nation and prompted Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras organizers to ask police late on Monday not to march at their annual parade this weekend.

Handgun ownership is highly restricted in Australia. Police are reviewing the gun handling procedures that enabled Lamarre-Condon to sign out his pistol to allegedly use in a violent crime while off duty.

“We’re in this position that a police firearm was used and that can never happen again,” said Police Commissioner Karen Webb said. “We have to look to ways to mitigate that risk in whatever way we can.”

Webb, who has taken part in the annual march in 2006, met with the Mardi Gras board on Tuesday to urge them to reconsider.

She later described the meeting as “fruitful” and “very respectful,” but police remained excluded from the parade on Saturday.

“There’s some positives that could come out of participating in Mardi Gras on Saturday, but it’s early days and we’ve got a few days left to work through this,” Webb said.

The Mardi Gras’ board said LGBTQ communities across Australia had been devastated by the loss of the couple, who had planned to celebrate at the parade.

“The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Board feels that having the NSW Police march this year could add to the distress within our communities, already deeply affected by recent events. The Board has taken the decision to request that the Police do not march in the 2024 Parade,” the board said in a statement.

“This decision was not made lightly, especially considering that many NSW Police members who participate in the Parade are also members of the LGBTQIA+ community and are navigating the impact of this tragedy alongside us. However, we believe that their participation at this year’s event could intensify the current feelings of sorrow and distress,” the board added.

State opposition lawmaker Jacqui Munro said the state government should withdraw funding from the event, which is a major tourist draw, over the exclusion of police.

State Premier Chris Minns said he hoped police would be allowed to march, but ruled out withdrawing government funding.

Other floats would have boycotted the parade if police were allowed to march due to grief and extreme anger in the community, said Pride in Protest spokeswoman Charlie Murphy, a Queer community activist.

The Mardi Gras began in 1978 as a Sydney street protest against homosexual discrimination that was violently broken up by police. Uniformed police officers have been marching since 1998 as a gesture of respect and support.

Sydney-born Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said relations between police and the LGBTQ community had come a long way since 1978.

“I think it’s been very good that the police have marched,” Albanese said.

“The relationships have been turned around and have been positive, but I understand that the Queer community in Sydney, in particular, are grieving what is an enormous tragedy,” he added.",Resume64,[],,"['shot', 'parade', 'bodies', 'policeman', 'exlover', 'community', 'saidthe', 'board', 'couple', 'mardi', 'dead', 'australian', 'property', 'sydney', 'gras', 'lesbian']",time_articles
Israel Open to Ceasefire During Ramadan Pending Hostage Deal,"Israel would be willing to pause its war on Hamas in Gaza during the upcoming Muslim fasting month of Ramadan if a deal is reached to release some of the hostages held by the militants, President Joe Biden said in comments released on Tuesday.

There was no immediate Israeli reaction to Biden’s comments on an emerging framework deal, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, under which Hamas would free some of the dozens of hostages it holds in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a six-week halt in fighting. During the temporary pause, negotiations would continue over the release of the remaining hostages and additional Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

A Hamas official played down any sense of progress, saying the group wouldn't soften its demands.

The start of Ramadan, which falls around March 10, is seen as an unofficial deadline for a cease-fire deal. The month is a time of heightened religious observance and dawn-to-dusk fasting for hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have flared in the past during the holy month.

Biden said Monday that he hopes a cease-fire deal could take effect by next week.

“Ramadan’s coming up and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,” Biden said in an appearance on NBC’s Late Night With Seth Meyers.

At the same time, Biden did not call for an end to the war, which was triggered by the deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, when militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted roughly 250 people, according to Israeli authorities.

Biden, who has shown staunch support for Israel throughout the war, left open the door to an eventual Israeli ground offensive in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, on the border with Egypt, where more than than half of the enclave’s 2.3 million people have fled under Israeli evacuation orders.

The prospect of an invasion of Rafah has prompted global alarm over the fate of Gaza civilians trapped there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said a ground operation in Rafah is an inevitable component of Israel’s strategy for crushing Hamas. This week, the military submitted for Cabinet approval operational plans for the offensive, as well as evacuation plans for civilians there.

Biden said he believes Israel has slowed its bombardment of Rafah.

“They have to and they have made a commitment to me that they’re going to see to it that there’s an ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder Hamas,"" he said. “But it’s a process.”

Read More: Why Rafah Marks a Turning Point in the Gaza War

Hamas official Ahmad Abdel-Hadi indicated that optimism on a deal was premature.

“The resistance is not interested in giving up any of its demands, and what is proposed does not meet what it had requested,” he told the Pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen.

Hamas has previously demanded that Israel end the war as part of any deal, which Netanyahu called “delusional.”

Israel’s devastating air, sea and ground campaign in Gaza has killed more than 29,700 people, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its count.

The fighting has obliterated large swaths of the urban landscape, displaced 80% of the battered enclave’s population and triggered a humanitarian crisis that has left a quarter of the population starving, according to the United Nations, and sparked concerns of imminent famine.

The first and only deal in the war, in late November, brought about the release of about 100 hostages—mostly women, children and foreign nationals—in exchange for about 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, as well as a brief halt in the fighting.

Roughly 130 hostages remain in Gaza, but Israel says about a quarter of them are dead.

Negotiations were still underway Tuesday in Qatar to hammer out the deal’s details. A senior official from Egypt has said the draft cease-fire deal includes the release of up to 40 women and older hostages in return for up to 300 Palestinian prisoners—mostly women, minors and older people.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, said the proposed six-week pause in fighting would include allowing hundreds of trucks to bring desperately needed aid into Gaza every day, including to the hard-hit north.

The History of Self-Immolation as Political Protest,"A U.S. airman died after setting himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 25 in order to protest what he called a “genocide” of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war. Aaron Bushnell’s action is part of a long and controversial history of self-immolation as political protest.

In the past, self-immolation has been used as an extreme form of protest against political leaders in Tunisia during the Arab Spring, the Vietnam War, and climate change. And Bushnell isn’t the first to self-immolate in protest of the Israel-Hamas war. In December, an unidentified individual self-immolated outside of the Israeli consulate in Atlanta, in what police described as “likely an extreme act of political protest.”

“It's an act of despair,” says Ralph Young, a history professor at Temple University. “You feel that there's nothing that you can do, or that people are willing to do, so this is the ultimate sacrifice—yourself.”

The practice of self-immolation dates back centuries, according to ancient Hindu tales of Sati, the wife of a Hindu god who got married without her father’s approval. Some retellings of her life say that Sati burned herself to death on her husband’s funeral pyre, and are used as justification for the practice of ritual suicide that has long been banned in India. Self-immolation was also seen as a sacrificial act committed by Christian devotees who chose to be burned alive when they were being persecuted for their religion by Roman emperor Diocletian ​​around 300 A.D.

One of the first and most well known acts of self-immolation in modern history was conducted by Thich Quang Duc during the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese monk set himself on fire in Saigon in 1963 in protest of the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government backed by the U.S. Several other monks followed his example.

Thich Quang Duc’s self-immolation became one of the most enduring and haunting images of the war. “The average American would have said, ‘Well, we're supporting democracy, and fighting against communism,’ and this image of this monk choosing this terrible way to die to protest against the American government, was really shocking,” says Michael Biggs, associate professor of sociology at Oxford University.

Some people in the U.S. also self-immolated as a means of protest during the Vietnam War, including a Quaker named Norman Morrison who set himself on fire outside the Pentagon while clinging to his child.

The tactic has not only been used to protest wars. In India in the 1960s, the practice was used in protest of the implementation of Hindi as a national language. In 2009, a Tibetan monk self-immolated in protest of Chinese rule in Tibet, in an incident that sparked mass protests in Western China. Over 100 monks set themselves on fire over several years.

More recently, the tactic has been used by climate activists to protest climate change. In 2018, David Buckel, a retired American lawyer, set himself on fire in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. In 2022, climate activist Wynn Alan Bruce set himself on fire at the plaza in front of the Supreme Court. “This act is not suicide,” Kritee Kanko, a climate scientest and friend of Bruce wrote on Twitter following the act. “This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to [the] climate crisis.”

”It's the most violent nonviolent type of action.

What We Know So Far About a New Palestinian Government,"Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and his government tendered their resignations to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday, in what many observers regard as the first step towards forming a new technocratic Palestinian administration to govern the Palestinian territories and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel’s war to root out Hamas from the besieged enclave comes to an end.

“The decision to resign came in light of the unprecedented escalation in the West Bank and Jerusalem and the war, genocide, and starvation in the Gaza Strip,” Shtayyeh said in his announcement, noting that “the next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the new reality in Gaza and the need for a Palestinian-Palestinian consensus based on Palestinian unity and the extension of unity of authority over the land of Palestine.”

President Abbas, who leads the Palestinian Authority which administers certain parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, accepted the resignations and has asked Shtayyeh’s government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is appointed.

Below, what we know so far about the new government.

What is driving this shakeup?

The resignation of Shtayyeh and his government constitutes “a complete cabinet reshuffle,” Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine Analyst at the International Crisis Group, tells TIME—one that she says can be read as an attempt to appease calls by the U.S. and others for the creation of a “revitalized Palestinian Authority,” under which Gaza and the West Bank can be reunited under a single governance structure after the war.

Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to Britain, told journalists on Tuesday that the formation of a new government represents a bid to “start afresh in the interest of the unity of the Palestinian people,” adding that it will not include any political factions. “This is not the time for political factions,” he says. “This is the time for the Palestinian people.”

Among those tipped for inclusion in this new government is Mohammad Mustafa, a former World Bank official and chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund, who Abbas is expected to appoint as prime minister, according to multiple news outlets. Widely regarded as an independent technocrat, Mustafa previously served as economy minister and deputy prime minister, during which time he was involved in the reconstruction of Gaza following the 2014 war. In January, Mustafa led the Palestinian delegation at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he told attendees that “the best way forward for all of us—including the Israelis—is statehood for Palestinians, peace for everybody, security for everybody. The faster we can move to this, the better.”

The PA, which was created 30 years ago as an interim government following the Oslo peace accords, currently exercises limited governance over parts of the occupied West Bank and no governance over Gaza, which it was expelled from by the Islamist group Hamas following the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. While a reformed PA is the preferred choice of the U.S. and others to govern the West Bank and Gaza as part of a renewed push for a two-state solution to the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the governing body enjoys little popularity among Palestinians, many of whom regard it as a subcontractor of Israel’s punishing military occupation. Indeed, a December poll conducted by Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that nearly 60% of respondents in the West Bank and Gaza support the PA’s dissolution—the highest percentage ever recorded in PSR polls. Demand for Abbas’s resignation is even higher, at around 90%.

Is Hamas expected to have a role in the new government?

The new technocratic government is expected to be made up of independent figures who are not affiliated with any Palestinian factions, including Hamas. As such, the International Crisis Group’s Mustafa says, the formation of the new government will not be determined by the militant group, nor will it involve any of its members.

“The international community have made it very clear that they will not engage in any kind of high-level diplomacy with Hamas,” Mustafa says, “so the idea of having them involved in any kind of government is just not even a workable proposition right now.” However, Mustafa adds that there is an expectation that former Hamas civil servants in Gaza will invariably be involved in the day-to-day governance of the Strip, on the condition that those individuals have no involvement in Hamas’s military wing.

What has the Israeli response been?

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the prospect of the Palestinian Authority having any role in Gaza after the war. Instead, he has offered up his own vision for the so-called “day after” the war, which proposes Israel maintaining indefinite control over the West Bank and Gaza, thus neutering the possibility of the establishment of a Palestinian state (which the Israeli government also rejects).

“Israel is sending a very clear signal here that Palestinian autonomy—nevermind self-determination—is simply out of the question,” Mustafa says.

What will the short-term impact of a new government be?

The current Palestinian government has overseen a period of immense instability in the West Bank, including rising Israeli settler violence and an economic crisis—one that has been exacerbated by the war as well as the Israeli government’s decision to withhold Palestinian tax revenues, which represent a major source of the PA’s income.

“Doing the bare minimum like providing education, employment, et cetera has been impossible,” says Mustafa. “A change of personnel in the PA doesn’t get rid of those obstacles.”

During Tuesday’s press conference, Zomlot conceded that a Palestinian government “cannot function” without control over its own revenues, resources, or borders. “It is absolutely crucial that we make sure that the new government is enabled and this is the conversation we are having with our regional and international partners.”

Will there be new elections?

Elections haven’t been held in the occupied Palestinian territories in nearly two decades. The last time Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza cast a vote was in 2006, when the Islamist group Hamas beat the secular movement Fatah in Legislative Council Elections, ultimately resulting in the latter’s expulsion from the Strip. Since then, administrative control of the Palestinian territories has been split between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the West Bank, where Abbas has ruled by presidential decree since winning his first four-year term in 2005. No subsequent presidential contests have been held since.

“This is not expected to be immediate,” Zomlot told TIME of new elections, noting that addressing the immediate crisis must be the first priority. But he added that a fresh vote should take place in a matter of “months, but not years.”",Resume67,[],,"['prime', 'minister', 'know', 'hamas', 'far', 'bank', 'west', 'war', 'authority', 'palestinian', 'gaza', 'mustafa']",time_articles
Human Rights Watch Accuses Israel of Blocking Aid to Gaza,"Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli government on Monday of blocking aid to the Gaza strip in violation of orders from the Hague, the U.N.’s highest ranking court.

“The Israeli government has simply ignored the court’s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid,” Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, said in a press release.

In its Jan. 26 ruling on a genocide case brought forth by South Africa in January, the Hague ordered Israel to “take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”

However, in the month since the order was issued, the average number of aid trucks entering Gaza has decreased by 30%, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Last week, the World Food Programme said that it was forced to suspend aid truck deliveries to Northern Gaza due to unsafe delivery conditions. The World Food Programme said that many desperate and hungry people attempted to climb onto one of its aid trucks and one delivery driver was badly beaten. Approximately 300,000 people in Northern Gaza relied on aid for life saving nutrition.

Israel has denied restricting the entry of aid into Gaza, and instead says it is the fault of humanitarian organizations operating inside Gaza that the aid has not been distributed. It claims that hundreds of trucks sit idly on the Palestinian side of the crossing. The U.N. has stated that it cannot always reach these trucks because the situation is too dangerous. On Monday, Netanyahu’s office also stated that the Israeli War Cabinet had approved a humanitarian plan that would help prevent looting of aid trucks in Gaza.",Resume68,[],,"['rights', 'humanitarian', 'trucks', 'human', 'aid', 'stated', 'israel', 'ruling', 'watch', 'accuses', 'world', 'israeli', 'gaza', 'blocking']",time_articles
French Senate to vote on enshrining abortion rights in constitution,"France's Senate is to vote on Wednesday on a bill meant to enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion in the constitution, a measure promised by President Emmanuel Macron following a rollback on rulings in the United States.

Wednesday's vote comes after the lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January.

A majority of senators appear to be in favor of the constitutional change, but some conservatives have criticized its wording, casting doubt over the outcome of the vote.

Macron’s government wants Article 34 of the constitution amended to specify that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.”

If the Senate adopts the same version of the bill as the National Assembly, the constitutional change will require definitive approval by a three-fifths majority of a joint session of parliament, traditionally held at the Palace of Versailles.

If the Senate amends the proposal or reject it, the bill must return to the National Assembly for further debate.

None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament is questioning the right to abortion, which was decriminalized in 1975.

The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it.

“Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says.

US backtrack on abortion inspired France to make it a constitutional right 05:11

In Poland, a controversial tightening of the already restrictive abortion law led to protests in the country last year. The Polish constitutional court ruled in 2020 that women could no longer terminate pregnancies in cases of severe fetal deformities, including Down Syndrome.

Navalny to be buried Friday in Moscow after venues refuse to hold farewell ceremony,"Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny's funeral service and burial will take place in Moscow on Friday, his spokesperson said, but his allies accused the Kremlin of thwarting their attempts to organise a bigger event a day earlier.

People lay flowers for the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at the monument to the victims of political repression in Saint Petersburg on February 24, 2024.

Kira Yarmysh, his spokesperson, posted on X that a service for Navalny would be held on Friday at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) in the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God in the Moscow district of Maryino where Navalny used to live.

Navalny would then be buried at the Borisovskoye cemetery, which is located on the other side of the Moskva River to the south, Yarmysh said.

Отпевание Алексея состоится в церкви иконы Божией Матери «Утоли моя печали» в Марьино 1 марта в 14.00. Приходите заранее.

Похороны пройдут на Борисовском кладбище. — Кира Ярмыш (@Kira_Yarmysh) February 28, 2024

Such services, presided over by a priest and accompanied by choral singing, usually allow people to file past the open casket of the deceased to say their farewell. The chosen Russian Orthodox church is an imposing five-domed white building in a built-up suburb of southeastern Moscow.

It was not immediately clear how the authorities would ensure crowd control.

But judging from previous gatherings of Navalny supporters - whom the authorities have designated as U.S.-backed extremists - a heavy police presence is likely and the authorities will break up anything they deem to resemble a political demonstration under protest laws.

""The funeral will take place the day after tomorrow and I’m not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband,"" Navalny's wife Yulia said in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, where she won multiple standing ovations.

Navalny, 47, died at an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16. His allies have accused President Vladimir Putin of having him murdered because the Russian leader could allegedly not tolerate the thought of Navalny being freed in a potential prisoner swap.

They have not published proof to back up that accusation, but have promised to set out how he was murdered and by whom. The Kremlin has denied state involvement in his death and has said it is unaware of any agreement to free Navalny prior to his death.

Accusations

Navalny's death certificate, according to supporters, said he died of natural causes.

His mother last week accused the authorities of trying to blackmail her into holding a private funeral for her son by initially withholding his body, an assertion the Kremlin called absurd.

Yulia Navalnaya told the European lawmakers in Strasbourg: ""Putin killed my husband.""

""On his orders, Alexei was tortured for three years. He was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world and denied visits, phone calls and then even letters,"" she said. ""And then they killed him. Even after that they abused his body and abused his mother.""

In the 12 days since her husband's death, Navalnaya has staked a claim to take on the leadership of Russia's fragmented opposition, saying she will continue his work.

Speaking in English, her voice sometimes faltering, she described Putin as a ""bloody monster"" and told lawmakers it was not possible to negotiate with him.

""You cannot hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions that is no different from the previous ones,"" she said, calling for more effective action against the money flows of the ruling elite.

What was needed, she said, was a search for ""mafia associates in your countries, for discreet lawyers and financiers who are helping Putin and his friends to hide money.""

Funeral venue

Navalny's allies had been looking for a hall to accommodate his supporters at a farewell ceremony, but said they had been refused everywhere.

""Initially we planned the farewell and funeral for February 29th. It quickly became clear that there was not a single person who could dig a grave by the 29th of February,"" Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, wrote on X.

Feb. 29, Thursday, is the same day as Putin is due to deliver a speech to Russia's political elite and Zhdanov accused the authorities of not wanting Navalny's funeral to take place on the same day and overshadow it.

Zhdanov also accused the authorities of blocking attempts to secure a large hall for supporters to bid farewell to Navalny. ""Bastards. They won't give us the date we want. They won't give us the hall. Everyone will say goodbye to Alexei anyway,"" wrote Zhdanov, who is outside Russia.

The Kremlin has said it has nothing to do with arrangements concerning Navalny's body.

Ilya Gambashidze: Simple soldier of disinformation or king of Russia’s trolls?,"ON THE TROLL TRAIL

He may not be a household name, but Ilya Gambashidze appears to be involved in almost all of the latest Russian disinformation operations across the world. His disruptive cyber actions earned him a spot last year on the European sanctions list. But a FRANCE 24-RFI profile of Russia’s mystery man of manipulation reveals an operative with a far smaller disinformation stature than the Kremlin’s previous troll czar, the late Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Ilya Gambashidze (foreground) was added to the list of Russians sanctioned by the European Union in July 2023.

Advertising Read more

He emerged from anonymity in the West in the summer of 2023. Ilya Gambashidze’s name first appeared on the July 2023 Council of the European Union’s list of Russian nationals subjected to sanctions.

The list – which transliterated his last name from the original Cyrillic text as “Gambachidze” – noted that he was the “founder of Structura National Technologies and Social Design Agency” and was a “key actor” in Russia’s disinformation campaign targeting Ukraine and a number of West European countries.

By November, the US State Department was citing Gambashidze in a media note on the Kremlin’s efforts to covertly spread disinformation in Latin America.

The tactics cited in the US and EU documents detail the disinformation strategies employed in a vast operation dubbed Doppelganger by EU officials, which clones and creates fake websites impersonating government organisations and mainstream media.

The Social Design Agency (SDA) and Structura were described by the US State Department as “influence-for-hire firms” with “deep technical capability, experience in exploiting open information environments, and a history of proliferating disinformation and propaganda to further Russia’s foreign influence objectives”.

The SDA fulfills a dual role, according to Coline Chavane, threat research analyst at Sekoia.io, a French cybersecurity company. ""The SDA acted both as a coordinator of the various players involved in these disinformation campaigns, and as an operator, creating false content,"" she explained.

Exploiting crises from Ukraine to Gaza war

In addition to being a prolific disinformer, Gambashidze is also an opportunistic one. Months after his name appeared on the European sanctions list, Gambashidze was busy trying to fan tensions between France’s Muslim and Jewish communities following the Gaza war launched by Israel in response to the October 7 Hamas attack.

The French foreign ministry has linked an anti-Semitic Star of David graffiti campaign in the Paris region to Operation Doppelganger. Viginum, the French government agency for defence against foreign digital influence, has accused the SDA of seeking to amplify the surge in anti-Semitism in France by using bots to proliferate Star of David posts on social networks.

The Kremlin has even cited Gambashidze as the chief organiser of a new anti-Western propaganda campaign in Ukraine, according to documents detailing a disinformation plan signed by the SDA boss and leaked to Ukrainian media.

In the leaked documents, Gambashidze is presented as one of the main shadow advisors to ""The Other Ukraine"", a massive Kremlin propaganda operation targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“One reason for talking about Gambashidze is he looks very central. His name keeps cropping up including with respect to Ukraine,” said Andrew Wilson, a professor of Ukrainian studies at University College London.

When contacted by FRANCE 24, the Council of the European Union declined to comment on the importance that Brussels attaches to this Russian propagandist, citing the ""confidentiality of preparatory work"" in deciding whether to sanction an individual or a company.

Gambashidze is not the only Russian involved in Operation Doppelganger cited by the EU. Individuals linked to the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence unit, have also been sanctioned.

Nor is he the sole orchestrator of the new disinformation campaign in Ukraine. He is also said to have worked with Sofiya Zakharova, an employee of the Russian Department of Communications and Information Technology, dubbed “the brain” of Operation Doppelganger.

In the footsteps of Yevgeny Prigozhin

With the SDA and Structura cropping up in multiple Western investigations and news reports on Russian disinformation, Anton Shekhovtsov, a Ukrainian political scientist and director of the Austrian-based Centre for Democratic Integrity, notes that his omnipresence suggests that ""Ilya Gambashidze and the SDA are gradually replacing Yevgeny Prigozhin and his troll factory"".

Before the Wagner militia chief’s death in August 2023, Prigozhin ran a network of “troll farms” that conducted disinformation operations covering vast ground, from the 2016 US presidential elections and the Brexit vote to online anti-West campaigns in Africa and Asia.

Prigozhin’s death in a plane crash just two months after he led a failed mutiny in Russia has left the disinformation throne vacant, according to Shekhovtsov. ""There's a place up for grabs and the competition is fierce. For now, Ilya Gambashidze appears to be well placed,"" he noted.

But Gambashidze has not yet reached Prigozhin’s disinformation stature, and his vast domain could be divided between several inheritors. ""We are currently witnessing a restructuring of the propaganda ecosystem in Russia. There isn't necessarily one player at the heart of the system. It's more like a network that's being set up,"" said Chavane.

In the past, when Prigozhin was the tutelary figure of the Kremlin’s cyber propaganda, ""disinformation was organised in a pyramid structure, whereas we seem to be moving more towards a spider's web structure with several players linked together in a network"", explained François Deruty, Sekoia’s chief operations officer.

A discreet Rasputin of disinformation

Gambashidze and Prigozhin have a difference in style as well as stature. The middle-aged Gambashidze, with his rather stern Russian technocrat demeanor, has none of the bluster and media showmanship of the late Wagner boss. While Prigozhin was known for his public boasts and rants, Gambashidze’s modus operandi appears to be discretion.

Very little is known about his private life, and the Internet provides little information about him – not even basic details such as his age. According to Russian investigative journalist Sergei Yezhov, Gambashidze is 46 years old.

There are no details about his birthplace, education and family life either. The only available piece of information is that he comes under the fiscal jurisdiction of a Moscow tax office. Photographs of Gambashidze are equally rare, and one of the most recent shows an austere-looking man with thinning hair and no other distinguishing features.

On the European list of sanctioned individuals, he is described as having “formerly worked as a counsellor … to Piotr Tolstoi”. It’s a noteworthy detail. Piotr Tolstoi, commonly spelt Pyotr Tolstoy, is none other than the great-grandson of Russian literary icon Leo Tolstoy. The younger Tolstoy is the deputy chairman of the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. He was also deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe before Russia was expelled from the organisation – which is distinct from the EU – following the 2022 Ukraine invasion.

The lack of information, discretion and cited ties to prominent Russian politicians paints a picture of a mysterious master of manipulation, a latter-day Rasputin of disinformation.

‘Third-rate political technologist’

But images can also be deceptive. ""If there's so little information about him, it may be simply because he's not important enough in Russia,"" noted Andrey Pertsev, a journalist with the Latvia-based independent Russian website, Meduza, and an expert on Moscow's corridors of power.

Gambashidze’s case illustrates how the same individual can be perceived by two very different worlds. In the West, he is considered a threat, with Europe going so far as to include him on its list of sanctioned individuals. In Russia, on the other hand, he is at best ""a third-rate political technologist"", according to Pertsev, using a Russian term for the professional engineering of politics.

While the term “political technology” is largely unfamiliar in the West, it’s well known to Russian and Ukrainian audiences acquainted with the state’s manipulation of techniques to hijack and weaponise the political process.

It’s also the subject of Wilson’s latest book, “Political Technology: The Globalisation of Political Manipulation”, and Gambashidze appears to neatly fit the definition of a political technologist. “His career looks super typical. A lot of these political technologists are entrepreneurial. They sell services, they come up with ideas,” explained Wilson.

Internationally, political technologists are most often associated with Prigozhin, who sent dozens of them to African countries to help Moscow's protégés win elections. But most Russian political technologists are focused on domestic politics and local parties, according to experts. ""We mustn't forget that their main bread and butter consists of handling local elections, working for governors or parties,"" noted Shekhovtsov.

""That's where the money is,"" explained Pertsev. A political technologist's influence is therefore measured above all by the prestige of the election he or she is supposed to help win.

Gambashidze is no exception. He has handled elections in Kalmykia, one of Russia’s 21 republics, located in the North Caucasus, as well as in the Tambov Oblast, one of the least populated regions of central Russia.

""His [SDA] team often made mistakes and he was repeatedly called back to Moscow to avoid an electoral setback,"" explained Pertsev, who says he cannot understand how such an individual ended up in Brussels' crosshairs.

On the messaging service Telegram, anonymous accounts make fun of the questionable effects of Gambashidze’s advice to Batu Khassikov, governor of Kalmykia in 2019. Not only did Gambashidze fail to get Khassikov re-elected, but the incumbent’s popularity rating actually plummeted at the time.

A pig release backfires

In August 2023, a Gambashidze associate thought it wise to organise a release of pigs tattooed with the Communist Party emblem in Khakassia, a republic in southern Siberia.

The aim of the pig release was to discredit the republic's Communist governor, Valentin Konovalov. But the plan backfired: Gambashidze’s associate was accused by a section of the local population of ""ridiculing Russian history"" and he was fined for violating campaign rules.

But the SDA's most prestigious, if short-lived, client appears to have been Leonid Slutsky, who took over as head of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) in 2022 after the death of Russia’s notorious, far-right populist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

The new LDPR boss, aware of his lack of charisma, needed a political technologist. He ended up with Gambashidze. But he was quickly dismissed ""without a moment's hesitation, which means that Ilya Gambashidze is not considered very important in the Kremlin"", explained Pertsev.

How did such an individual come to be associated with large-scale disinformation operations on the international stage? ""Sometimes it's not competence that counts, but loyalty, and in Russia the quality of the network is central for a political technologist,"" noted Wilson.

In Gambashidze's case, the man who knows the man who knows President Vladimir Putin is Alexander Kharichev, a Kremlin adviser. But most important, according to Pertsev, is the fact that Gambashidze is “a fellow traveler” of Sergey Kiriyenko, a former Russian prime minister and currently the first deputy chief of staff in Putin’s administration.

In late December 2023, the Washington Post identified Kiriyenko as the top Russian official who tasked Kremlin political strategists with promoting political discord in France by amplifying messages to strengthen the French far-right. These included such talking points as the Ukraine war was plunging France into its deepest economic crisis ever or that it was depleting France of the weapons needed to defend itself.

""People come to Sergey Kiriyenko for electoral or other questions, and he delegates to Alexandre Kharitchev the task of finding the right political technologists,"" explained Pertsev.

Cannon fodder in the information war

This is how Gambashidze came to be involved in international disinformation operations, explained Pertsev. ""The main reason is that he's cheap,"" he explained, noting that in the Kremlin's order of budgetary priorities, getting the right candidate to win local elections is more important than launching a disinformation campaign in Western Europe.

What's more, ""the best political scientists would probably not be interested"", added Pertsev. For the big fish, working on disinformation campaigns targeting the West is not worth the risk since the domestic political market is more lucrative and they don't risk ending up on international sanctions lists. In a way, Gambashidze is simply informational cannon fodder.

Yet the Kremlin's great ideological war against the West – in which disinformation operations play an important role – has always been presented as a priority for Putin. It may seem incongruous to make a relatively minor figure like Gambashidze a central part of the disinformation schemes targeting the West.

But Gambashidze is not the only master on board. ""As the defence of Russian values has been elevated to a matter of national security, Russian spies are inevitably involved in this type of operation,"" noted Yevgeniy Golovchenko, a specialist in Russian disinformation at the University of Copenhagen.

Nor does the Kremlin require elaborate cyber-propaganda campaigns. ""The most sophisticated aspect is the diversity of media and means used. For Operation Doppelganger, the SDA called on local media, journalists and YouTubers to amplify their messages. They also set up a vast network of fake sites, some of which were only visible in a specific country,"" explained Chavane.

The fake news sites set up were rather crude clones of major news sites such as the French “20 minutes”, Germany’s “Der Spiegel” or British daily, “The Guardian”.

""The important thing is that these operations are inexpensive. One costs less than a missile over Ukraine. So even if they're not perfectly executed by Ilya Gambashidze, the bet is that by stringing them together over a long period, they'll end up working,"" explained Golovchenko.

In Moscow’s informational warfare set-up, Gambashidze is a key cog in the wheel, in an approach reminiscent of Russia’s military strategy in Ukraine: sending in wave after wave of troops, in the hope that the enemy's defences will collapse under the sheer numbers.

"🔴Live: Gaza deaths near 30,000 as UN warns of ‘imminent’ famine","About casualty figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry:

Gaza’s health ministry collects data from the enclave’s hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.

The health ministry does not report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of “Israeli aggression”.

The ministry also does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Throughout four wars and numerous skirmishes between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies have cited the Hamas-run health ministry’s death tolls in regular reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.

In the aftermath of war, the UN humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records. The UN's counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza health ministry’s, with small discrepancies.

"Zelensky to rally for support, weapons at Albania security conference","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to meet with leaders from southeast Europe in Albania on Wednesday, seeking to keep support and weapons flowing to Kyiv as Russia makes gains on the battlefield two years after invading its neighbour.

Advertising Read more

Zelensky has been crisscrossing the globe in recent weeks to rally support for his beleaguered country, as Ukraine's armed forces face a critical shortage of ammunition and struggle to hold back Russia's military advances on the ground.

He arrived in Albania late Tuesday and on Wednesday was due to meet in Tirana with several leaders from across the region during the ""Ukraine-Southeast Europe Summit"" -- his first visit to the Balkan nation since Russia's invasion in February 2022.

Zelensky's visit is ""a pivotal moment for fostering bilateral ties, and standing in solidarity with Ukraine in its heroic fight against Russia's aggression"", Albania's Foreign Minister Igli Hasani said in a social media post.

Great honor to welcome President @ZelenskyyUa to Tirana.

Albania, a NATO member since 2009, has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine but has stayed largely quiet in public about supplying Kyiv with arms.

During a visit to Albania earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised Tirana's backing of Ukraine.

""It was one of the first countries to send military aid to Ukraine in the wake of the Russian aggression -- guns, ammunition, mine resistant vehicles -- and it's currently one of the top ten per capita in terms of its support for Ukraine and security assistance,"" Blinken said.

Seeking aid

Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded with allies for more aid, warning that Ukrainian victory ""depends"" on the West boosting support.

Already massively outgunned, his country is fending off a renewed Russian offensive with dwindling ammunition that has had to be rationed.

EU allies are rallying to address that shortfall with a Czech-led plan to buy artillery from outside the bloc.

More than two years after Russia's invasion, the EU is facing the prospect of having to shoulder more of the aid burden as funds from the United States dry up.

Political infighting in the US Congress has stalled a vital $60 billion aid package, with the Republican right-wing, led by 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump, dramatically souring against Ukraine's cause.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, an ally of former president Donald Trump and head of a razor-thin Republican majority, has refused to allow a vote on the package.

French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile provoked backlash from fellow allies and a warning from the Kremlin this week when he raised the possibility of sending Western troops into Ukraine.

Before arriving in Tirana, Zelensky stopped in Saudi Arabia, where he sought to promote his peace plan and discuss potential prisoner of war exchanges.

Saudi Arabia maintains relations with both Russia and Ukraine and has mediated between the warring parties before, including a deal struck in September 2022 that saw the release of more than 200 captive Ukrainians.

"Biden, Trump win Michigan primaries but Democrats show discontent over Gaza","Joe Biden scored an easy win in Michigan's presidential primary Tuesday but was dealt a stinging rebuke over the war in Gaza in an Arab American-led protest that raised concerns over his bid to win the swing state in November's election.

Activist Natalia Latif tapes a Vote Uncommitted sign on the speaker's podium during an Election night gathering in Dearborn, Michigan, US, February 27, 2024.

There was little suspense over the outcome for both parties, with the president almost unopposed in the Democratic nominating contest and his predecessor Donald Trump declared the victor the Republican vote as polls were closing.

But tens of thousands of Democrats in a swing state crucial to Biden's reelection hopes ticked the ""uncommitted"" box as part of a push by the ""Listen to Michigan"" campaign to jolt the president into backing off from his support of Israel.

With almost two-thirds of polling stations still to report, the ""uncommitted"" share accounted for 50,000 votes, more than double the final totals in each of the last three election cycles.

Biden released a statement thanking voters, touting his record on working for Michigan's middle class and acknowledging that there was ""much left to do"" -- but made no mention of the Gaza conflict and ignored the protest vote.

""Listen to Michigan"" had set a modest goal of rallying 10,000 uncommitted voters in its aim to censure the president over US military funding for Israel, and to pressure him to call for an immediate ceasefire.

""President Biden has funded the bombs falling on the family members of people who live right here in Michigan -- people who voted for him, who now feel completely betrayed,"" the campaign said in a statement claiming victory.

'Completely betrayed'

The Gaza war started when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.

But concern has mounted amid the high civilian death toll in Israel's retaliatory campaign, now at almost 30,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.

The bloodshed has weakened Biden's standing among Muslims and Arab Americans, a bloc crucial to his 2020 victory in Michigan over Trump.

The Midwestern state has the largest proportion of residents who identify as being of Middle Eastern or North African descent in the country, with most of the population concentrated around Detroit.

The protest never threatened Biden's easy march to the nomination, and his sole challenger, Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips, was trailing with under three percent support late Tuesday.

Alarm bells

But the significant number of ""uncommitted"" votes could set off alarm bells ahead of the November general election, when Biden cannot afford to see his coalition eroded in the swing state.

The US Census Bureau estimates the statewide population claiming Middle Eastern or North African descent at 310,000, although the Arab American Institute says that figure is likely a significant undercount.

The organization estimates a nationwide Arab American population of 3.7 million and says the vast majority -- more than 80 percent -- are US citizens with the right to vote.

On the Republican side, US news networks projected Trump's victory within seconds of the polls closing, although he has to wait until the weekend for confirmation under a complex system splitting the contest over several voting days.

The former president has swept the early voting states and Michigan was never expected to interrupt his march to the nomination.

His sole remaining challenger, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, lost her home state of South Carolina to Trump over the weekend but has refused to quit, saying she doesn't believe the former president can defeat Biden.

"'Not at war with Russia': European, US allies taken aback by Macron's comments on troops in Ukraine","French President Emmanuel Macron faced uneasy reactions from European allies and a warning from the Kremlin on Tuesday after he refused to rule out the dispatch of Western ground troops to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.

French President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a press conference at the end of the conference in support of Ukraine, with European leaders and government representatives, at the Élysée Palace in Paris, France, February 26, 2024.

Macron said after a conference of European leaders on Monday that ""everything that is necessary"" must be done to ensure the defeat of Russia, including deploying troops.

The Kremlin warned of the ""inevitability"" of confrontation between NATO and Russia if troops from the alliance were deployed in the conflict, which would break a major taboo the West has so far been reluctant to challenge.

Macron hosted the conference just over two years to the day after Russia invaded Ukraine – seeking to rally greater support for Kyiv, which faces increasing battlefield challenges and dwindling munition stocks.

He painted a grim picture of Russia under President Vladimir Putin, arguing there had been a ""change of posture"" even in recent months that had seen a hardening of its stance both domestically and in Ukraine.

While there was ""no consensus"" on the sending of Western ground troops to Ukraine, ""nothing should be ruled out. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,"" Macron added.

'Not at war with Russia'

Macron had refused to say more about France's position, citing the need for ""strategic ambiguity"" but saying the issue was mentioned ""among the options"".

""We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensable to security and stability in Europe,"" Macron said.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, accused by critics of being too cosy with Moscow, said after the meeting that there was disunity on the issue among European leaders.

""There are countries that are ready to send their own soldiers to Ukraine, there are countries that say never – Slovakia is among them – and there are countries that say that this proposal should be considered,"" he said.

Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden, which is set to join NATO, poured cold water on the idea, saying ""it's not on the cards at all for the moment"".

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a tetchy message on X: ""We agreed that everyone must do more for Ukraine in Paris yesterday. Ukraine needs weapons, ammunition and air defence. We are working on it. It is clear: there will be no ground troops from European countries or NATO.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, if NATO troops appeared in Ukraine, ""we (would) need to speak not about a possibility but of the inevitability"" of confrontation.

""This is absolutely not in the interests of these countries, they should be aware of this,"" he added.

A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, emphasised ""there are no plans for NATO combat troops on the ground in Ukraine"" despite the ""unprecedented military support"" from the alliance.

The Italian government said support for Ukraine did not include sending troops.

""When we talk about sending troops, we must be very cautious because we must not make people think we are at war with Russia,"" said Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani.

""We are not at war with Russia,"" he said.

But the United Kingdom issued a somewhat more circumspect reaction, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman saying there were no plans for a ""large-scale"" troop deployment to Ukraine.

'Belligerence threshold'

It is understood that any Western troops eventually sent to Ukraine would have no mandate to fight Russian forces but work on priorities outlined by Macron in his news conference, including de-mining, securing neighbouring countries such as Moldova and thwarting cyberattacks.

""We are not talking about soldiers on the front line, in combat, but about specific activities, far from the front,"" said Rym Momtaz, consultant research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

But in parliament, Macron came under fire from far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen who accused him of ""taking a further step towards belligerence, posing an existential risk to 70 million French people"".

French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne told lawmakers that while new actions to support Ukraine such as demining and arms production could require a military presence on Ukrainian territory, this would not break ""any belligerence threshold"".

There are growing doubts about the viability of long-term US backing for Ukraine as a new aid package struggles to find legislative approval and Donald Trump, who has indicated opposition to further support for Kyiv, eyes a return to the presidency in elections this year.

""It's our future, Europe's future that is at stake. We must have the possibility to do without (the United States), not out of defiance, pessimism or fear but because it depends on us,"" said Macron.

U.S. President Joe Biden said Israel has agreed to halt military activities in Gaza for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as the Islamist group studied the draft proposal.

Based on a statement provided to Reuters by the source, the draft proposal for the first stage of the deal would last 40 days and the prisoner-hostage exchange would be at an overall ratio of 10 to one.

Also included in the proposal:

Both parties stop their military operations completely.

Aerial reconnaissance operations over Gaza will stop for eight hours a day.

All Israeli hostages, including women, children under 19 years of age, the elderly aged 50 years and above, and the sick, must be released in exchange for a specific number of Palestinian prisoners according to the numbers listed below.

In exchange for the 40 hostages listed under the humanitarian category, approximately 400 Palestinian prisoners will be released, according to the ratio of 10 prisoners to one hostage.

Gradual return of all displaced civilians - except men of military service age - to the northern Gaza Strip.

After commencing the first phase, Israel will reposition its forces away from densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip.

Commitment to bring in 500 trucks per day of humanitarian aid.

Commitment to providing 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans.

Allowing the rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries in Gaza, including immediately allowing the entry of necessary equipment and providing shipments of fuel for these purposes, according to quantities to be agreed upon.

Israel agrees to the entry of heavy machinery and equipment to remove rubble and assist with other humanitarian purposes, with the provision of fuel shipments necessary for these purposes, according to quantities to be agreed upon, provided that they increase over time. Hamas pledges not to use these machines and equipment to threaten Israel.

It is understood that the arrangements agreed in the first phase will not apply to the second phase, which will be subject to subsequent separate negotiations.

Abbas accepts resignation of Palestinian government in West Bank,"About casualty figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry:

Gaza’s health ministry collects data from the enclave’s hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.

The health ministry does not report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of “Israeli aggression”.

The ministry also does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Throughout four wars and numerous skirmishes between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies have cited the Hamas-run health ministry’s death tolls in regular reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.

In the aftermath of war, the UN humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records. The UN's counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza health ministry’s, with small discrepancies.

‘Kremlin Leaks’: Files detail Putin’s €1 billion propaganda effort ahead of presidential vote,"Information warfare

Leaked documents describe the Kremlin's concerted efforts to influence public opinion – using cinema, streaming series and TV programmes – to promote a narrative of Russian heroism, traditional values and loyalty towards President Vladimir Putin ahead of his March 15-17 bid for re-election.

Advertising Read more

Internal Kremlin documents obtained by the Estonian news website Delfi revealed the workings of a €1 billion effort to keep Vladimir Putin comfortably in power and promote Russian nationalism on the home front.

The “Kremlin Leaks” documents show how Moscow is waging what it calls an “information war” inside Russia. The most recent documents obtained by Delfi – working in partnership with around 10 other international media outlets – date back to December 2023.

The overriding objective of this propaganda push is to re-elect Putin for a fifth term in the upcoming presidential election on March 15-17. About €631 million was allocated for the Kremlin’s information war, according Vsquare, an investigative journalism site specialising in Eastern European news that also worked on the documents.

But the Kremlin is also paying special attention to what it calls “new territories” – referring to Russian-occupied areas in mainly eastern Ukraine, where it has spent hundreds of millions of euros “to ensure the population’s loyalty”, notes Vsquare.

The total planned budget for this state-sponsored “information war” ahead of the presidential elections was €1.1 billion. The entertainment sector – television, cinema and online content – takes the lion's share of this budget, notes Meduza, an independent Russian investigative site that was a partner in the project.

Files seen by Meduza reveal the Putin administration's focus on creative works that highlight “traditional values​” and show that “positive changes in the way Russians live are fundamental trends”.

Content should strive to exalt “modern [Russian] heroes of whom everyone can be proud” and should also aim to promote the unity of the country by offering a sense of national belonging to “residents of the new territories”, as the documents refer to residents of Russian-occupied east Ukraine.

This type of roadmap “is nothing new in spirit, and is reminiscent of the guidelines given for film studios in the 1930s”, says Jeff Hawn, a Russia specialist at the London School of Economics, referring to the Hays code of standards used for decades by the US film industry.

“The ‘Kremlin Leaks’, above all, reveal the financial details of the ecosystem set up to push the narrative desired by Russian power,” says Vlad Strukov, professor at the University of Leeds and a specialist in Russian cinema.

Around 15 organisations and associations received nearly €600 million to produce content in line with the objectives outlined by Russian authorities. The big winner of this funding, according to the leaked files, is the Institute for Internet Development (IID), which has received more than €400 million since the beginning of 2023.

The IID was founded in 2015 to “establish dialogue between stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem and the government”, according to a 2023 Meduza article devoted to the institute's rising influence. But in 2017 its purpose changed, and the IID became a fund for financing content aimed at young people, Meduza said.

But the IID no longer just churns out memes or series for teenagers. It now represents one of the main sources of financing for films and TV shows in Russia, according to Meduza. It is the archetype of these ""alternative organisations” taking the place of former sources of funding for the arts that the “regime uses to push its own narrative”, explains Strukov.

For the presidential election, the IID has prepared a “creative campaign content” document detailing a dozen film projects, broadcasts and even music festivals.

One such series, called ""GDR"" (for German Democratic Republic, as East Germany was known during the Cold War), is about the daily life of an intelligence officer of the period. Strukov said it “gives a positive image of the security services agent”, responsible for fighting against Western influence. The subject of the series is a barely veiled allusion to Putin, who held a similar intelligence position in his younger years.

There is also “20/22”, a series that evokes the love story between a young Russian who goes on a “humanitarian mission in the Donbas” with a young woman opposed to the “special military operation” (the official euphemism used by Moscow to refer to the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine).

According to Hawn, this is the first time that Putin’s team has gone to such lengths to guarantee victory at the polls for the Russian president. “It shows how, since the war, Putin and his inner circle have had to be more proactive and hands-on to frame the narrative before an election, because they cannot trust the system to work for them as much as before,"" Hawn said.

Since Putin’s re-election is assured, the aim is to “pre-rig the election” – to do as much as possible ahead of time so that the actual ""manipulation of voting results is as small as possible”.

If the flood of pro-Putin propaganda can increase the president’s margin of victory, it will send a message “to the Russian political class and give the impression that Putin still has big support among the masses, and therefore there is no reason to look for an alternative”, said Hawn.

He said another lesson from Kremlin Leaks is the increasingly ideological orientation of the Russian regime. The cult of personality has long been a feature of Putin’s rule, but “one of Vladimir Putin’s strengths, before the war in Ukraine, was that he knew when to be pragmatic”.

But now, the Kremlin is emphasising the ideological battle with a “decadent West” and is using all the tools of propaganda at its disposal to champion Russian “values”.

Despite the Kremlin's attempts to control the narrative, “Russia is not China in terms of controlling access to culture – the public can see Western productions or those from South America and Asia,” Strukov observed.

The leaks show the way in which the regime “delegates the production of the narrative developed by the Kremlin to different structures, like the IID, to be able to produce a competitive media offer in the face of these other influences”.

Meduza cited one IT insider as saying that the state finally realised that ""the content on that massive, costly Internet was being produced by everybody except the state itself"".

Blaming the overnight assault on activists from the opposition Socialist Party Without Borders (PSF), headed by Yaya Dillo, the government said that ""the situation is now completely under control"" and ""the perpetrators of this act have been arrested or are being sought and will be prosecuted"".

The attack came after a party member was arrested and accused of an ""assassination attempt against the president of the supreme court"", it said.

Dillo is a fierce opponent of Chad's transitional president, his cousin Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno.

He denounced the attack against the supreme court president as ""staged"".

The ANSE attack comes a day after the announcement that Chad will hold a presidential election on May 6, which both Mahamat Deby Itno and Dillo intend to contest.

Mahamat Deby Itno took power in Chad after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed while fighting rebels in 2021, after ruling the desert nation for three decades.

Guinea appoints former opposition leader Mamadou Oury Bah as prime minister,"Transitional authorities in junta-led Guinea have appointed one-time opposition leader and economist Mamadou Oury Bah to the role of prime minister, according to a decree read on national television on Tuesday.

The political veteran faces a challenging task setting up a government amid an indefinite general strike launched this week over deep economic hardships and the military authorities' allegedly repressive policies.

Television footage showed Bah taking the oath of office in front of interim President Mamady Doumbouya, a special forces commander who ousted former President Alpha Conde in a coup in 2021.

Bah, commonly know as Bah Oury, has been a prominent figure on the Guinean political scene since the early nineties. He served as minister of reconciliation in a consensus government in the wake of a political crisis triggered by the killing of at least 130 people in union-led protests in 2007.

The founder and vice president of the UFDG party later spent four years in exile in France, during which time he was convicted in absentia for a 2011 assassination attempt against Conde.

He returned to Guinea in 2016 following a presidential pardon, but was later pushed out of UFDG. In recent years, he has faced criticism for his support of the junta.

A Ukrainian soldier in France speaks about writing and recovery,"VOICE OF A SOLDIER

Ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, Ukrainian soldier and author Oleksandr “Teren” Budko spoke to FRANCE 24 about his path to recovery after losing both legs, his approach to writing and his patriotism.

Advertising Read more

On a recent evening at the Ukrainian Cultural Institute in France, Oleksandr “Teren” Budko stood with his interpreter before a large audience of Ukrainians and other nationalities. Blond and with a boyish face, the 27-year-old Ukrainian soldier was on the French leg of his European book tour for “Story of a Stubborn Man”. The autobiography interspersed with memories from the front lines recounts his road from civilian to soldier and then to battle-scarred veteran.

Budko began writing the book in October 2022, just two months after losing both legs after a shell landed near him in a trench during the counteroffensive for the city of Kharkiv. “I found inspiration for my writing on the front lines,” he said. Even before the injury, he had been publishing short texts accompanied by pictures of him and his buddies in combat gear as they worked to repel the Russian enemy.

Athletically built and wearing a quilted blue shirt and shorts that showed his prosthetics, Budko was as comfortable as a stand-up comedian in front of a crowd. “There is no truth in the leg,” he said, repeating a Ukrainian proverb that suggests a person who has walked a lot cannot tell the truth because they are tired.

Appreciation for a war hero

Yet he wanted to get as close to the truth as possible while writing his book. He wanted to capture the voices of his comrades and the sights and the sounds of what he experienced in eastern Ukraine. He would try to write, but then get stuck with month-long bouts of writer’s block. A trip to Florida, where he went to get fitted with sports prosthetics so he could participate in the Invictus Games, finally changed something in him. “I was there under the sun, I swam in the sea in Miami, I ate at McDonald's – and this gave me the perfect circumstances to write this book,” he said.

Thousands of miles away from Ukraine, he revisited his prior experience as a Ukrainian soldier. His days were filled with rehabilitation but, at night, he would write. Like plunging into the nearly clear waters off the Atlantic coast, he immersed himself in his memories of fighting the war and typed them up on a computer.

“Some of the people I wrote about in the book are dead, and that’s why it was so hard to write the text,” said Budko. Luckily, many people in the book did survive, “including my comrade Artem”, he said, nodding toward a young man in a wheelchair sitting in the front row. The audience responded with lengthy applause in appreciation of the two young men for their sacrifice – and for coming home alive.

Memories from the war

Budko agreed to an interview the next day to talk about what led him to fight in the war and his memories from that time. After a visit to Paris's Carnavalet Museum, with its elaborate displays dedicated to the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, the young man in a black hoodie settled at a kebab restaurant on the Rue des Rosiers, an eclectic street in the Marais neighbourhood of central Paris. He was accompanied by his editor and a lively group of young Ukrainians who, judging by their level of excitement, appeared to be visiting the French capital for the first time.

Sitting with his back against the wall, a bit apart from the group, Budko suddenly seemed less like a comedian and more like a wise old man. “I wrote this book for civilians and for people who had never seen war, so they could understand what happens on the front lines,” he said.

Through his interpreter, Budko said he was in Kyiv when the war began on February 24, 2022. “I signed up as a volunteer because I wanted to defend my country from the enemy and help it gain independence,” he said.

Although he had never held a weapon before in his life, he joined the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion, a battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces established in May 2022. After some training and taking part in the defence of the capital Kyiv, Budko was deployed to northeastern Ukraine near Izium.

Most people in the battalion were volunteers who accepted the consequences of their choice, remembered Budko. “Of course Bakhmut and Avdiivka exist (two besieged cities known for scenes of the most ferocious violence of the war), but the life of a soldier is not only about fighting,” he added.

Budko recalled one moment when he ate a slice of foie gras for breakfast: “For me, it was a sign I was still alive,” he said. Despite being trained as killing machines, Budko said he and his fellow volunteers continued civilian life to the best of their ability, preparing traditional meals like borscht, a red beetroot soup, and taking the time to enjoy them with each other. This also meant saving abandoned cats and dogs and evacuating elderly people from zones that had become too perilous for them to stay.

An invincible optimism

From the trenches, the soldiers watched Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s speeches and followed news reports on military support from abroad. “We were interested in how the war was going to end, but of course the weapons situation was important too, because without weapons it was going to be impossible to end the war,” said Budko. “Despite the many weapons given, it was never enough.”

Writing the book also allowed Budko to relive some of the moments from “one of the best times of my life”, he said. The adventure, the camaraderie and the moments of peace, such as when he would lie down on the ground with a book, seem to have left Budko with a sense of nostalgia devoid of any bitterness. But today he preferred not to talk about the day he suffered the injury that caused him to lose both legs: “There is no trauma, but I’ve told the story too many times.”

Budko said he has always been endowed with an invincible optimism. He said what changed after the injury is that he “became braver and more open to people”.

Thinking back to his time in the service, the young man recalled the discovery of a small kobzar (a Ukrainian bard) figurine he made one day while digging trenches in the Kharkiv region. The statue was more confirmation that the lands were Ukrainian, he said, because kobzars never existed in Russia. It further convinced him of his role in preserving Ukrainian territorial integrity.

Ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Budko likened the war to a “David against Goliath” struggle and voiced a warning about the existential nature of the threat: “The less support Ukraine gets, the closer the enemy gets to other European countries.""

With this in mind, his goal today is to ""contribute to the Western population’s understanding of the war, and encourage them to support us so that they can help obtain a Ukrainian victory as soon as possible”.

‘We are not in a position to make plans’: The uncertain exile of Ukrainians in France,"WAR IN UKRAINE

Two years after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the end of the war is nowhere in sight. Ukrainian refugees in France are each adapting in their own way, with many preparing to stay for the long term.

Advertising Read more

Two years of Russia’s war in Ukraine have forced over 14 million people – nearly one third of Ukraine’s population – to flee their homes, according to the UN. Around 69,000 of those people have found refuge in France as of January 2024.

The figure is modest compared to European countries like Poland and Germany, which have welcomed five to 10 times that amount, but it reflects less a lack of generosity on the part of the French than the desire of Ukrainian refugees to seek shelter where there is already a large Ukrainian diaspora. The situation of Ukrainian refugees in France is “uncertain” and “evolving”, according to many of the exiles themselves.

“My situation and that of the other [Ukrainian] musicians is very unique because we are in France for work, and we never had to live off of subsidies,” said Anna Stavychenko, the head of a special mission of the Paris Philharmonic that coordinates temporary contracts with French orchestras for Ukrainian musicians displaced by the war. “Yet the situation is unstable: we do not know how long we will have our jobs, and we are not in a position to make any other plans besides day-to-day activities.”

Maryna Kumeda, author of ""Journal d'une Ukrainienne"" (“Journal of a Ukrainian”), said the ongoing war was tearing families apart. “People who arrive in France with their children generally have a harder time returning to Ukraine because it means exposing the children to bombing and interrupting their schooling,” she said.

Women in exile remain separated for months or years at time from their husbands and partners, as men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been prohibited from leaving Ukraine since the declaration of martial law following Russia's invasion. The distance may be contributing to what some Ukrainian mental health professionals are calling a “divorce epidemic”, with the number of Ukrainian marriages ending last year twice or even three times as high as before the war.

“People want to go home but they ask themselves – is there work, is it safe?” said Kumeda. Some make a leap of faith and return, despite all the uncertainty. A hairstylist from Bucha exiled in France recently took a bus back to Kyiv, despite facing a lower salary and fewer clients.

In another case, a woman temporarily left her child in the care of his grandparents in France and went back to Ukraine. “She missed her husband and she hadn’t been home for two years,” said Kumeda.

'Caught between two countries'

Factors such as care obligations and the breakdown of family units may prevent the integration of Ukrainian refugee women, noted an OECD study from 2023. The availability of adequate child care is an important factor for parents with young children to integrate into the workforce. Another study found that three in ten refugees could not work because of childcare obligations, and it was more often a problem for Ukrainian women (33 percent) than men (9 percent).

Other challenges mentioned by Ukrainian refugees included learning the French language. Most Ukrainians do not speak French, but numerous cities across France have allowed Ukrainian refugees with ""temporary protection"" status to benefit from French language courses. When encountering administrative difficulties, some refugees said they depended on the support of local communities for help in resolving them.

Many refugees report feeling “caught between two countries”. They are grateful for the asylum they found in France but unable to detach themselves from their prior lives in Ukraine.

“This has been a difficult and painful period for Ukrainians,” said Mykyta Zigura, a Ukrainian artist and refugee currently living in Nice. “We support Ukraine with all our might by giving donations and organising activities while trying to adapt to life in France – for the future of our children, and for the privilege of experiencing life in a highly developed country like France,” he said.

Mykyta’s brother, Egor Zigura, said he was grateful to have access to the same services and rights as French citizens, such as insurance, granted through the temporary protection status given to Ukrainians since the war began. “Thanks to the support of French society, many of us have started to adapt and we have the possibility to develop, work and live a full life despite the war, and while continuing to support Ukraine.” He added that Ukrainian associations in France, like Nice's AFUCA, were helping support and integrate Ukrainians into local communities and acting as intermediaries between French and Ukrainian nationals.

Many Ukrainian refugees say they firmly believe support for their cause has not diminished over time. For Egor, everyone should oppose Russian aggression because “the soldiers in Ukraine are not only defending the borders of our country, they are stopping the enemy forces from advancing across Europe. It is more important than ever to unite and stop the enemy.""

But criticism of the bill has been fierce, especially on social media, where some have slammed the draft bill as unfair, saying it will only serve to punish the poor.

“So gorgeous, so classy!,” 31-year-old conservative lawmaker Antoine Vermorel-Marques exclaims as he films himself pulling out a pair of shoes from a box purportedly ordered from the hugely popular Chinese fast-fashion online giant Shein. “Treated with phthalate, a substance which is an endocrine disruptor that can make us sterile,” he adds as an ironic kicker.

In the parody-like video posted on TikTok in mid-February, Vermorel-Marques unpacks and shows off his great “hauls” in much the same way many of the platform’s fashion and beauty influencers do to promote new products they have purchased or been ""gifted"" by the brand.

But Vermorel-Marques’s video is hardly meant to promote Shein’s products. It is intended to accompany his draft of a fast-fashion ""kill bill"" he recently proposed to the National Assembly.

The bill is expected to be debated in the lower house of parliament in the next few months and was drafted to support France’s ailing textile industry which has been hard hit by the country’s growing fast fashion consumption. The bill calls for a €5 penalty for any fast-fashion purchase.

Fast fashion, or the high-speed, low-cost production of the latest trends, has grown so strong in France in recent years that it is threatening the future of many traditional and domestic fashion manufacturers. The average price tag for a piece of Shein clothing is estimated at just €7. Oxfam France describes fast fashion as “disposable”, warning on its website that it has ""disastrous social and environmental consequences"".

Although a host of brands fall under the fast-fashion category, Vermorel-Marques is particularly targeting the “ultra-fast-fashion” online retailer Shein. The China-founded but Singapore-based company is estimated to add between 6,000 and 11,000 new offerings to its catalogue every single day. The brand has frequently come under fire for the environmental and social consequences of its throw-away business model, and according to Vermorel-Marques, for “destroying France’s textile industry”.

But it did not take long for the draft bill to whip up a storm, with some likening the €5 penalty to yet another tax primarily penalising the poor as well as restricting their access to affordable and trendy clothes.

‘Another step towards injustice’

Shein, and peers like Temu and Boohoo, have found an appreciative audience among consumers who rarely have to spend more than €10 to fill their wardrobes with the latest trending skirts, tops, trousers or accessories.

“In France, there’s a gap between our convictions, the awareness that we need to make an effort, and acceptance of the measures to combat these issues,” said Cécile Désaunay, director of studies at Futuribles, a consultancy firm that analyses transformative societal, lifestyle and consumption trends.

Désaunay said that this €5 penalty is particularly sensitive “because it touches on what is considered the freedom to consume"".

However, she emphasised that the law is not just meant to punish but also to reward, and would work as a bonus-penalty system that would make sustainable fashion more accessible to everyone.

In an interview with the quarterly narrative journalism publication Usbek&Rica, Vermorel-Marques explained how the system is meant to work: While a fast-fashion shopper would be slapped with a €5 penalty for every purchase, a person buying an environmentally friendly and domestically-produced piece of clothing would instead receive a €5 bonus.

“What is key here is that it’s not another tax,” he said. “We’re not here to take money from you. We’re just saying: ‘If you pollute, you pay. And if you don’t pollute, you win’. It’s a win-win for both the consumer and the planet.”

A supporter of the bill took to the social media platform X to expand on the lawmaker’s argument:

“This isn’t a ‘tax’. Shein, Ali[Express], etc. are already taxed, but what we’re talking about here is a penalty punishing those who participate in fast fashion, and by extension, in the exploitation of people and the increase in waste.”

Désaunay noted it was not the first time the bonus-penalty system has been used to draw up new legislation to encourage more responsible and sustainable consumption behaviour, pointing to, among other things, the bonus offered to French car buyers who opt for less-polluting vehicles, and Sweden’s initiative to reduce the value-added tax on used item repairs.

Although Désaunay said she completely understands peoples’ need to dress themselves, many, and especially younger shoppers, now over-consume thanks to low-cost brands like Shein.

‘I’m poor, but I have values’

“Before, the norm was to have fewer clothes, but that lasted longer. We paid more for them, but we made them last,” Désaunay explained. “Today, we’ve moved away from that mentality. We have clothes that are not as strong, that don’t last as long, and we’re getting used to always having more of them because they cost less.”

On social media, the draft bill has divided users. ""Fast fashion for some, the only way to dress for others,"" one user wrote, while another stated: “I’m poor, but I have values, I don’t order from these sites! You can be poor and have values!”

Désaunay said that many get trapped in the mindset “that in order to dress cheaply, you have to buy clothes ‘Made in China’, as if there are no other alternatives”. One sustainable alternative, she noted, is simply to turn to second-hand shopping.

“The challenge for the textile industry is that charities and other recycling centres are bursting at the seams with [used] clothes,” she said. “Given the amount of clothes already on this planet, we could still dress humanity for another 100 years even if we stopped making them.”

But despite the many positives related to second-hand shopping, Désaunay said it is still often frowned upon “and even rejected by the poorest in society”, due to the stigma attached to wearing ""hand-me-downs"".

According to a report by shopping application Joko, Shein had a 13 percent French market share in value terms at the end of 2023, making it France’s second-favourite online fashion brand. The No. 1 spot, however, was claimed by Vinted, a rapidly growing second-hand clothing platform.

“The fast-fashion mentality is coming to an end,” Désaunay said.

Although the proposed bill has not even been debated yet, she said it will serve as a “pretext to rethink the value of the items we buy”: “If it’s not expensive, it’s because there’s a trade-off. In this case, an environmental trade-off.”

The fast fashion industry has regularly been shamed for how its business model damages the environment (the cheap and toxic chemical pollutants used in the dyes, as well as the consumption of water and fossil fuels), negatively impacts climate change (CO2 emissions) and how it exploits human rights (forced labour). In a recent report, the French chapter of the environmental grassroots network Friends of the Earth (FoE) estimated that Shein alone produces some 1 million garments per day, which corresponds to between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

But, the group pointed out, brick-and-mortar fast-fashion retailers such as Zara, H&M, Primark and Uniqlo are hardly better. “[What they] don't do in terms of quantity of new offerings, they make up for in quantity produced, as well disrespect of human rights,” FoE said, noting that these brands have all been accused of either profiting from, or having profited from, forced labour by China’s Uighur population.

In 2022, Shein recorded roughly $23 billion in sales, according to the Wall Street Journal. For 2023, its sales are estimated at nearly $32 billion.

France's foreign doctors suffer insecurity as understaffed hospitals struggle to function,"On the ground

The situation for several thousand foreign doctors working in French hospitals has become more complicated since the end of the exemption scheme put into place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nearly 1,900 of these practitioners have now lost their right to practise, a great loss for French hospitals already struggling with shortages of medical staff. FRANCE 24 spoke to some of them.

Karima*'s last visit to the prefecture was a complete nightmare, as her residence permit was not renewed. ""All I have is a receipt"", she says. This is despite the fact that she has been working as a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon – including in the emergency department, where she is on call at least four nights a month – for the past two years in a hospital in the Parisian suburbs. ""My colleagues in general surgery asked me to come help out,"" says the surgeon, who is originally from a country in North Africa*. ""I'm not going to let them down,"" she says, although she doesn't know how much longer she will be able to practise.

Even though the hospital has agreed to let her work, Karima is concerned that her contract, which is renewed every six months, will be allowed to expire. She is one of some 4,000 medical practitioners with qualifications from outside the European Union known as ""Padhue"" (for the acronym of praticiens diplômés en dehors de l'Union européenne) who have been working in French hospitals for years in precarious positions such as ""acting intern"".

""The work I do is real work, the work of a practitioner, even though I'm on an intern contract for which I get paid 1,400 euros net and which has to be renewed every six months. The prefecture refused to renew my residence permit because of these breaches of contract,"" says the doctor, who is constantly going back and forth with the authorities to try and stabilise her situation. ""This time, the prefecture is asking me for a work permit provided by the regional health agency, which no longer wants to provide it, as the law has changed.""

On December 31, 2023, the exemption scheme that allowed establishments to employ Padhue staff under a variety of precarious arrangements expired, making it impossible for them to continue working. As of January 1, these doctors must sit highly selective and competitive examinations known as ""knowledge verification tests"" (épreuves de vérification des connaissances, or EVC) before they can be reinstated. Posts under the scheme are hard to come by, with 2,700 available for over 8,000 applicants in 2023, some of whom try their luck from abroad. As a result, the majority of the Padhue doctors found themselves out of the running this year.

After an outcry from French unions, the government finally promised to ""regularise a number of foreign doctors"" and renewed their temporary work permits another year so that they can sit the 2024 EVC.

‘I don't understand why I'm not being judged on my experience here’

However, Karima’s problems are far from over, as she tried to sit the EVC in paediatric orthopaedic surgery in 2023 but her application was rejected. ""They tell me that I don't have the right diploma, that I need one in paediatric orthopaedics, but my country doesn’t offer this type of diploma! I don't understand why I'm not being judged on my experience here. I operate on my own, I consult, I have my own patients,"" she says.

When she arrived in France in 2020, she did not have long-term plans to live on this side of the Mediterranean. ""I had been sent to France for further training in orthopaedic surgery because I had noticed shortcomings in the department where I was working in North Africa,"" she says. But after almost two years as an associate trainee at a university hospital in Nice, Karima found herself stuck in France because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the closure of her country's borders. She also lost her job in North Africa.

While in Nice, she worked on the front lines during the Covid-19 pandemic alongside French medical staff, lending a hand in intensive care. ""We saved lives. And we'll continue to do so. It's what we do. Sometimes in the emergency department, I find myself in a situation where I have to react in a split second, do the right thing and make the right decision to save someone.""

‘I regularly pack my bags’

Sometimes Karima thinks about returning to North Africa. ""I ask myself the question if I can go on in this situation. But I have a job that I love, especially the children. I'm attached to my patients. When I see in their eyes that they're satisfied, I feel useful."" However, she is thinking more and more about leaving, as she wants a life where she can plan beyond a day-to-day basis. ""I regularly find myself packing my bags. I hesitate to order new furniture."" Those close to her have suggested that she apply for a job in Germany. ""Some of my colleagues have gone there. They were accepted on the basis of their applications and took German language courses,"" she says.

Against the backdrop of its overwhelmed healthcare system, France is in desperate need of additional medical staff, but risks losing thousands of these doctors to other European countries.

Dr Aristide Yayi is originally from Burkina Faso and qualified in forensic medicine in Dakar, Senegal. He has been working for three years as a general practitioner at the only residential care home for senior citizens (""Ehpads"", in France) in Commercy, a small town in the northeastern Meuse department. France's elder care sector is in desperate need of doctors. ""My contract runs until July 2024. After that, I don't know what's going to happen,"" says Yayi. He wants to develop a pain management service for the Ehpad residents, but this project may never see the light of day if his situation does not become more stable. ""I've been on one training course after another, with six-month contracts as an 'acting intern'. It's always uncertain and precarious. I feel like I'm being treated like a junior doctor,"" he says.

Hospital services under threat without foreign doctors

Several hospital department heads, particularly in the Paris region, have warned that they will be ""forced to close"" if no more foreign doctors are hired. At his January 16 press conference, President Emmanuel Macron admitted that France needed these practitioners, saying he wanted to ""regularise a number of foreign doctors, who help to hold our system together"". This promise was reiterated by newly-appointed Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in his general policy speech at the end of January.

French unions are now demanding that this rhetoric be followed by action. At a meeting with the health ministry on February 15, they welcomed the previous day’s publication of the decree renewing temporary work permits for foreign doctors who undertake to sit the 2024 EVC. However, Olivier Varnet, general secretary of the National Union of Hospital Doctors FO, criticised the decree, saying it was ""a first step"" that ""merely postpones the problem for a year"".

Meanwhile, foreign doctors are suffering, as almost 1,900 of them are unable to work at the moment. ""My old department is desperately looking for someone to replace me. They're really struggling. I was in charge of two units with 20 patients each. It's absurd,"" says Mostapha, who worked in a follow-up care and rehabilitation unit in Normandy. His contract as an ""associate practitioner"" was suspended on January 1, as he was not permitted to sit the knowledge verification tests. ""The hospital wanted to keep me, but the regional health authority didn't authorise it,"" he says.

‘Some candidates failed, even with top marks’

A graduate of the Faculty of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Algiers, he followed his wife, a French national, to France three years ago. ""I don't have any problems with my papers – I have a 10-year residence permit,"" he says.

Mostapha hopes that his case will be examined more closely and that the new decree will enable him to return to work. However, he doesn’t really believe that taking the exam will help him get his career back on track: ""I’m planning to take it again because for the moment there's no other solution, although the chances of passing it are getting smaller and smaller because of the number of posts. It's worse than selective.""

Many unions believe that the exam is more reflective of a quota system than an actual ""verification of knowledge"". ""Some candidates failed with an average of more than 15 [out of 20, a highly competitive result],"" says Laurent Laporte, general secretary of the CGT's Federal Union of Doctors, Engineers, Managers and Technicians. The unions say the test is ""too academic"", ""random"", ""opaque"" and ""discriminatory for doctors working more than 60 hours a week"". The health ministry promised on February 15 to ""reformulate the EVC"" by making it more practical.

Two men found guilty in 2002 murder of Run-DMC's Jam Master Jay,"A jury on Tuesday found two men guilty of the 2002 murder of Run-DMC rap pioneer Jam Master Jay, who was fatally shot at his New York City recording studio in one of the most infamous killings in rap history.

Ronald Washington, 59, and Karl Jordan Jr., 40, were convicted of federal charges of murder while engaged in drug trafficking in the shooting of Jam Master Jay, the stage name of Run-DMC founding member Jason Mizell, the US attorney's office in Brooklyn said on the X social media platform.

The verdict came after a month-long trial at the US District Court in Brooklyn.

Both men were well known to Mizell, who prosecutors said was killed in a business dispute over a lucrative deal to distribute cocaine in Baltimore. Washington was a childhood friend, and Jordan was Mizell's godson. All of them grew up in the same neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens.

In the 1980s, Mizell and his Run-DMC bandmates helped usher hip-hop into the mainstream with hits including ""It's Tricky"" and the cover of Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"" off the best-selling 1986 album ""Raising Hell.""

In their lyrics and stage shows, they were known to advocate against illegal narcotics. The group even recorded a ""Just Say No!"" anti-drug public service announcement in the late 1980s for the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

But as Mizell's music-industry success waned in the 1990s, he turned to dealing cocaine to help fund his music career, according to prosecutors in the US attorney's office in Brooklyn.

During the trial, prosecutors called witnesses who were in the studio the night that Mizell, 37, was shot dead on Oct. 30, 2002, including Mizell's friend Tony Rincon, who was shot in the leg that night by one of Mizell's killers. They also called witnesses who told jurors that Jordan and Washington confided to people close to them that they were the killers.

Prosecutors said Jordan and Washington conspired to kill Mizell after the musician cut them out of the drug deal in Baltimore worth nearly $200,000.

Lawyers defending Washington and Jordan both bluntly told the jury that the defendants did not kill Mizell. The defense called a single witness, an expert who testified on the frailty of human memory, in order to discredit prosecution witnesses recounting decades-old events.

Washington and Jordan face a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum of at least 20 years.

In May, a third defendant, Jay Bryant, was also indicted in the murder and is due to face a separate trial in 2026.

In the prosecutors' account of the night of the murder, Bryant, a friend of Jordan whom Mizell did not know, entered the front door and let Washington and Jordan in through a locked back fire exit, both armed with handguns, prosecutors said.

Mizell stood up from a couch to greet his godson. Jordan shot him in the head from a few inches away, killing him instantly, prosecutors told the jury. All three defendants fled moments later, they said.

Prosecutors said Rincon and other eyewitnesses were too afraid to tell police at the time who killed Mizell, and even fled New York in fear of their own safety.

EU approves landmark bill to restore 20% of the bloc's land and seas by 2030,"EU lawmakers on Tuesday gave the final green light to a milestone bill aimed at protecting nature in the bloc, overriding conservative attempts to torpedo a law that has angered European farmers.

Farmers have a long list of grievances including EU legislation and have taken to the streets across Europe.

The rules are a central part of the EU's ambitious environmental goals under the Green Deal – a set of laws aimed at helping the bloc meet its climate goals – but farmers say they threaten their livelihoods.

The legislation demands the European Union's 27 member states put in place measures to restore at least 20 percent of the bloc's land and seas by 2030.

Farmers have a long list of grievances and have taken to the streets across Europe, clogging roads including in Brussels where EU institutions are based.

Protests continued on Tuesday in Spain, where farmers in the northeastern Catalonia region gathered near the French border. Meanwhile, thousands of Polish farmers demonstrated against the Green Deal and other gripes in Warsaw.

They lament what they say are excessively restrictive environmental rules, competition from cheap imports from outside the European Union and low incomes.

Heeding their call for less red tape and bureaucracy, the conservative European People's Party (EPP) said at the start of parliament's session in Strasbourg that it would not approve the law, putting the future of the legislation in jeopardy.

Those attempts were in vain as the text passed with the support of 329 lawmakers while 275 voted against. It will enter into force after formal adoption by EU states.

""Today is an important day for Europe, as we move from protecting and conserving nature to restoring it,"" said Cesar Luena, the lawmaker who spearheaded the legislation through parliament.

""The new law will also help us to fulfil many of our international environmental commitments. The regulation will restore degraded ecosystems while respecting the agricultural sector by giving flexibility to member states,"" he added.

Before the vote, EPP chief Manfred Weber said the law had been ""badly drafted"".

""The EPP group is fully committed to climate change and also to the biodiversity goals, also agreed on an international level, but this law is not delivering on these issues,"" he told journalists in Strasbourg.

'Fighting for planet's survival'

Liberal and socialist lawmakers as well as green activists hailed the move.

""The Nature Restoration Law has always been so much more than a law to bring back nature. It is a symbol that Europe can, and will, commit to fighting for the survival of our planet,"" the #RestoreNature coalition, consisting of BirdLife Europe, ClientEarth, EEB and WWF EU, said in a statement.

Pascal Canfin, the French MEP who heads the parliament's environment committee, thanked the EPP lawmakers who voted for the text.

""If we have won the battle for the law on nature restoration, it is because part of the European right was able to resist allying with the anti-ecological populism of the far-right, against multiple false and misleading attacks on this text,"" he said.

He said the law was committed to reversing the trend of nature's regression in Europe.

Not everyone was happy. Right-wing ECR MEP Bert-Jan Ruissen, who voted against the bill, described its approval as ""very unfortunate"".

""The consequences will be enormous. Nature conservation will become more important than food security, housing needs or road safety,"" he warned.

Qatar 'hopeful' of new Israel-Hamas truce in next few days,"About casualty figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry:

Gaza’s health ministry collects data from the enclave’s hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.

The health ministry does not report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of “Israeli aggression”.

The ministry also does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Throughout four wars and numerous skirmishes between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies have cited the Hamas-run health ministry’s death tolls in regular reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.

In the aftermath of war, the UN humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records. The UN's counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza health ministry’s, with small discrepancies.

Paris metro seeks to reduce delays due to fainting passengers,"It's the announcement Paris metro passengers dread: Traffic has been disrupted due to a traveller fainting in another train miles down the tracks. A commuter passing out on the French capital's underground causes their train to stop to wait for rescue services, and provokes delays of up to 45 minutes along the line.

A Paris Metro train crosses the river Seine in front of the Eiffel Tower at dawn on February 23, 2024.

There were on average 10 such incidents a day in 2018, according the capital's RATP transport authority, including because panicked fellow travellers sounded a danger alarm that caused the train to grind to a halt on the tracks, sometimes in a tunnel.

It said 98 percent of cases – announced to passengers on the metro as a ""malaise voyageur"" – were ""mild"" dizzy spells.

But with the Paris Olympics just months away, the head of the Paris region on Tuesday said the old policy of keeping unwell passengers on board would be scrapped.

""When a passenger feels unwell, we will... no longer stop the train,"" said Valerie Pecresse, who is head of the Ile-de-France region that includes Paris and is responsible for its transport system.

""What we need is to get the person out of the train"" so they can be treated on the platform, she added, saying a new standard emergency response plan had been validated.

Some social media users poked fun at the announcement with GIFs, including one of a man being lobbed into a rubbish skip.

There has been growing concern over the quality of service of Paris trains as commuters suffer delays and breakdowns just months away from the Olympics.

Other causes for hold-ups include unattended luggage.

Pecresse said transport authorities would not remove suspicious packages but use sniffer dogs to inspect them more rapidly.

On the RER B line connecting the capital with the Charles de Gaulle international airport some 360 bags were left unattended a year, she said.

The regional transport authority has also come under fire for increasing the price of metro tickets during the Olympics.

France bans 'steak' and 'escalope' labels from vegetarian products,"The French government issued a decree Tuesday banning the term ""steak"" on the label of vegetarian products, saying it was reserved for meat alone.

French Minister for the Economy and Finances Bruno Le Maire (R) inspects the production line of gourmet vegetable steak at the HappyVore factory in Chevilly, central France, on May 17, 2023.

Other terms that can no longer be used for meat-free products include ""escalope"", ""ham"", ""filet"" and ""prime rib"", according to the decree.

The ruling is a response to a long-standing complaint by the meat industry that terms like ""vegetarian ham"" or ""vegan sausage"" were confusing for consumers.

It is based on a 2020 law whose application was temporarily suspended by the State Council in June 2022 after a complaint from Proteines France, a consortium of French companies selling plant-based food.

According to the revised decree published Tuesday, some products containing a small amount of plant-based content can continue to use meaty names, such as merguez sausage, bacon or cordon bleu.

Producers elsewhere in the European Union can continue to sell vegetarian food with meat names in France.

Proteines France has been arguing that the French law is at odds with EU food rules.

Individuals breaking the labelling law can be fined up to 1,500 euros ($1,630), rising to 7,500 euros for companies.

But producers have one year to sell their existing stock before any penalties are applied, the decree said.

"Biden sees backlash over Gaza, Trump faces GOP holdouts in Michigan primaries","While Joe Biden and Donald Trump are marching toward their respective presidential nominations, Michigan's primary on Tuesday could reveal significant political perils for both of them.

A man attends to vote at a voting site, as Democrats and Republicans hold their Michigan primary presidential election, in Detroit, Michigan, US February 27, 2024.

Trump, despite his undoubted dominance of the Republican contests this year, is facing a bloc of stubbornly persistent GOP voters who favor his lone remaining rival, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and who are skeptical at best about the former president's prospects in a rematch against Biden.

As for the incumbent president, Biden is confronting perhaps his most potent electoral obstacle yet: an energized movement of disillusioned voters upset with his handling of the war in Gaza and a relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that critics say has been too supportive.

Those dynamics will be put to the test in Michigan, the last major primary state before Super Tuesday and a critical swing state in November's general election. Even if they post dominant victories as expected on Tuesday, both campaigns will be looking at the margins for signs of weakness in a state that went for Biden by just 3 percentage points last time.

Biden said in a local Michigan radio interview Monday that it would be “one of the five states” that would determine the winner in November.

Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation. More than 310,000 residents are of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry. Nearly half of Dearborn’s roughly 110,000 residents claim Arab ancestry.

It has become the epicenter of Democratic discontent with the White House’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war, now nearly five months old, following Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack and kidnapping of more than 200 hostages. Israel has bombarded much of Gaza in response, killing nearly 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to Palestinian figures.

Democrats angry that Biden has supported Israel's offensive and resisted calls for a cease-fire are rallying voters on Tuesday to instead select “uncommitted.”

FRANCE 24's UN correspondent Jessica Le Masurier reports from New York 02:04 Jessica Le Masurier reports from New York 2024 © FRANCE 24

The “uncommitted” effort, which began in earnest just a few weeks ago, has been backed by officials such as Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, and former Rep. Andy Levin, who lost a Democratic primary two years ago after pro-Israel groups spent more than $4 million to defeat him.

Abbas Alawieh, spokesperson for the Listen to Michigan campaign that has been rallying for the “uncommitted” campaign, said the effort is a “way for us to vote for a ceasefire, a way for us to vote for peace and a way for us to vote against war.”

Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to Biden. Alawieh said the “uncommitted” effort wants to show that they have at least the number of votes that were Trump’s margin of victory in 2016, to demonstrate how influential that bloc can be.

“The situation in Gaza is top of mind for a lot of people here,” Alawieh said. “President Biden is failing to provide voters for whom the war crimes that are being inflicted by our U.S. taxpayer dollars – he’s failing to provide them with something to vote for.”

Our Revolution, the organizing group once tied to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has also urged progressive voters to choose “uncommitted” on Tuesday, saying it would send a message to Biden to “change course NOW on Gaza or else risk losing Michigan to Trump in November.”

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden backer who held several meetings and listening sessions in Michigan late last week, said he told community members that, despite his disagreements over the war, he would nonetheless support Biden because he represents a much better chance of peace in the Middle East than Trump.

“I also said that I admire those who are using their ballot in a quintessentially American way to bring about a change in policy,” Khanna said Monday, adding that Biden supporters need to proactively engage with the uncommitted voters to try and “earn back their trust.”

“The worst thing we can do is try to shame them or try to downplay their efforts,"" he said.

Trump has drawn enthusiastic crowds at most of his rallies, including a Feb. 17 rally outside Detroit drawing more than 2,000 people who packed into a frigid airplane hangar.

But data from AP VoteCast, a series of surveys of Republican voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, reveals that his core voters so far are overwhelmingly white, mostly older than 50 and generally without a college degree. He will likely have to appeal to a far more diverse group of voters in November. And he has underperformed his statewide results in suburban areas that are critical in states like Michigan.

Several of Trump’s favored picks in Michigan's 2022 midterm contests lost their campaigns, further underscoring his loss of political influence in the state. Meanwhile, the state GOP has been riven with divisions among various pro-Trump factions, potentially weakening its power at a time when Michigan Republicans are trying to lay the groundwork to defeat Biden this fall.

Both Biden and Trump have so far dominated their respective primary bids. Biden has sailed to wins in South Carolina, Nevada and New Hampshire, with the latter victory coming in through a write-in campaign. Trump has swept all the early state contests and his team is hoping to lock up the delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination by mid-March.

Nonetheless, an undeterred Haley has promised to continue her longshot presidential primary campaign through at least Super Tuesday on March 5, when 15 states and one territory hold their nominating contests.

As Haley stumped across Michigan on Sunday and Monday, voters showing up to her events expressed enthusiasm for her in Tuesday’s primary -- even though, given her losses in the year’s first four states, it seemed increasingly likely she wouldn’t win the nomination.

“She seems honorable,” said Rita Lazdins, a retired microbiologist from Grand Haven, Michigan, who in an interview Monday refused to say Trump’s name. “Honorable is not what that other person is. I hate to say that, but it’s so true.”

"Junta 'losing control on the ground', Myanmar's opposition foreign minister says","Zin Mar Aung, the foreign minister in Myanmar's opposition National Unity Government (NUG), spoke to FRANCE 24's Marc Perelman about the ongoing conflict in her country. The NUG supports the rebel groups that are fighting the ruling junta. These groups ""have regained almost 60 to 70 percent of the territory"", she claimed.

Three years after the coup in Myanmar, the junta faces an armed rebellion from ethnic groups, backed by the NUG. The junta ""are losing on the ground and they already lost people's support since day one. [They are] gradually losing practical control of the ground every day, it is very clear"", Zin Mar Aung said.

The National Unity Government claims to control some parts of the country, but has not claimed a large city or major military infrastructure so far. ""It's very difficult to say exactly, but we estimate that almost 60 percent of Myanmar's territory is under the control of the ethnic armed organisations and NUG-controlled areas. Altogether, almost 60 to 70 percent of the territory is under the control of the Federal Democratic Forces,"" she stated.

In October 2023, an offensive led by several ethnic armed groups proved successful. ""The military is weakened and many ethnic organisations are joining our revolutionary cause. On the ground, we are even setting up our local governance to substitute their governance system,"" Zin Mar Aung explained.

On the reports of mass surrenders within the regular army, she estimated that ""almost 20,000 deserters are already on our list, but there might be more than that."" The junta recently brought back mandatory military service through a conscription law. ""It is the sign that they are losing, and also it is a false conscription law because they don't have the legal and political rights and authority to activate that law"", she said.

Zin Mar Aung explained that the cooperation between her organisation and ethnic rebel groups was established by ""a joint chain of command"". She predicted that within a few months, ""the revolutionary forces will put more and more pressure on the capital"".

Asked about who provides the rebels with weapons, she said they are receiving them from deserters but that ""initially, it is very homemade weapons"" and that they also get some arms thanks to their ""own production"".

Zin Mar Aung underlined that the pressure on the junta is supposed to bring about ""internal changes"" to make them ""transform themselves"". ""Our pressure is not only military means, but also political, diplomatic and economic means,"" she said.

Asked about the role of China in the conflict, she declared that Beijing ""is quite cautious"" and ""concerned about the leadership in this military coup"", adding that the junta ""does not reflect"" China's own interests.

On the support of Western governments, Zin Mar Aung said she hoped to see some ""levers of recognition"" such as ""the legitimate representative of the people of Myanmar"" and for the opposition's representatives to be officially hosted abroad. Although this is not yet the case in France, she said that she appreciated France's humanitarian support on the ground but noted that the ""French parliament is much more active than the French government"".

In conclusion, she declared that a ""Federal Democratic Union is the only possible way out for Myanmar"", along with a ""new Constitution"". ""We already have basic principles based on the Federal Democracy's charter, which will be the basic document for the new Constitution.""

"In Spain, Ukrainian civilians prepare for battle at a training centre near Madrid","Located one hour from Madrid, the Toledo Training Command centre is one of the largest military training centres in Europe. Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians who have volunteered to head to the front are training there as part of the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM), set up in October 2022. Spain is one of the EU's key training providers, having already trained 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers. FRANCE 24's Rémi Cadoret, Armelle Exposito and Bertrand Aguirre report.

Advertising

As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, the Ukrainian army is seeking 500,000 more soldiers to make up for losses on the battlefield and relieve exhausted troops. But this request faces political opposition in Kyiv: a controversial mobilisation bill has been blocked in parliament for several weeks.

However, Ukrainian civilians continue to volunteer to serve their country. Most have no military experience. To train them, Kyiv can count on the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM), a training programme set up by the bloc in October 2022. Some 35,000 soldiers have already been trained in one of the 24 countries participating in the mission.

We visited a participating training centre in Spain. The Toledo military academy welcomes a contingent of 200 future Ukrainian soldiers every five weeks. These men and women come from all walks of life: some are farmers, others factory workers, others executives. Although sometimes disoriented by their new environment, they are keen to learn techniques that will enable them to survive on the front line.

Shooting, mine clearance and urban combat: Five weeks' training to learn it all

Spanish instructors have just five weeks to teach the basics of shooting, urban combat and mine clearance. They face several problems: the soldiers's age – 40 on average – and the language barrier. To communicate with the recruits, who don’t speak Spanish, the instructors are supported at all times by translators.

The Ukrainian volunteers are motivated, and it only takes a few days for team spirit to develop. ""Five weeks isn't much, but it's all we have,"" explains Lieutenant Angel, who supervises them. ""The days are long because they have to assimilate a lot of techniques. And the first week is dedicated to getting back into shape, as most of them are not in good physical condition.""

At the ceremony marking the end of their training, each soldier receives a cross blessed at the sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima and an image of Saint Michael the Archangel, the patron saint of Kyiv. A talisman they hope will protect them at the front.

For security reasons, the faces of the soldiers in this report have been blurred.

Senegal crisis talks rule out presidential vote before Sall's term expires,"Political crisis talks called by Senegal's President Macky Sall on Tuesday reached a ""broad consensus"" that the presidential vote he postponed could not be held before his mandate ends on April 2, multiple participants told AFP.

Senegal's President Macky Sall (C) delivers a speeh during the National Dialogue in Diamniadio on February 26, 2024.

Advertising Read more

Sall's two-day ""national dialogue"" aimed at setting a date for the delayed election also advocated the head of state remain in office beyond the end of his term and until his successor is installed.

The conclusions go firmly against the view of a widespread political and civic movement, which is demanding the poll be held before April 2.

The traditionally stable West African country is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades after Sall's last-minute deferral of the February 25 election.

The Constitutional Council overturned the delay and Sall on Monday launched two days of talks to set a new date – boycotted by major political and social actors.

Two committees were formed to discuss the election date and the organisation of the period after April 2.

The first committee came to the almost unanimous conclusion that the vote could not be held before April 2, four participants told AFP.

Two participants, Amar Thioune and Mamadou Lamine Mane, even said there was a ""broad consensus"" that the presidential election could not be held before June 2.

The second committee came to a ""broad consensus"" in favour of President Sall remaining in office until a successor is sworn in, six participants told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Some taking part in the talks proposed the vote should take place in July, the same sources told AFP, referring to discussions rather than any written document.

The two committees were due to present their conclusions to the president late Tuesday.

No indication was given as to when Sall would then make a decision.

Last week, he said he would set a date ""immediately"" if there was a consensus.

'Get it over with'

The president has previously cast doubt on the feasibility of staging the vote before the end of his term.

On Monday, he proposed that it could be held by the start of the rainy season in June or July.

Sall had reiterated several times in recent days that his mandate would end as planned at the beginning of April.

But on Monday, he left open the possibility of an extension.

""If there's a consensus, I'm prepared, in the best interests of the nation, to take it upon myself to stay on even if it's not my choice,"" he said.

""It's not what I want because I'm in a hurry to get it over with and leave,"" he added.

The February 3 decision to postpone the presidential election plunged Senegal into turmoil, with four people killed in clashes.

Sall, in power since 2012, said he called off the vote over disputes about the disqualification of potential candidates and fears of a return to unrest as in 2021 and 2023.

The opposition called it a ""constitutional coup"".

The Constitutional Council, the top constitutional body, ruled the delay unlawful and called for the vote to be organised ""as soon as possible"".

A possible extension of Sall's term is likely to raise more constitutional concerns.

The Council said on February 15 that Mr Sall was due to leave office on April 2.

Boycott

The movement galvanised against the election delay says the president is playing for time, either to benefit his political allies or to remain in power.

Seventeen of the 19 candidates approved by the Constitutional Council to stand in the presidential poll boycotted Sall's national dialogue, as did the major civil society collective Aar Sunu Election (Protect Our Election).

The collective had called for shutdowns across the country and a general strike on Tuesday, demanding the poll take place before Sall leaves office.

But the call appeared to go largely unheeded in central districts of the capital Dakar.

""We live from day to day, so we can't afford to go a day without working, otherwise our families won't eat,"" said shopkeeper Saer Dieng, 37.

S.Africa sees sharp rise in rhino poaching with nearly 500 killed last year,"Conservationists raised the alarm on Tuesday as South Africa reported a sharp increase in rhino poaching, with almost 500 animals killed last year.

A wild white rhino is seen at an undisclosed location in the North-West Province of South Africa, on April 2, 2023.

Advertising Read more

The country is home to a large majority of the world's rhinos and a hotspot for poaching, which is driven by demand from Asia, where horns are used in traditional medicine for their supposed therapeutic effect.

The environment ministry said that, despite government efforts to tackle the illicit trade, 499 of the thick-skinned herbivores were killed in 2023, mostly in state-run parks. This represents an 11 percent increase over the 2022 figure.

The figures paint ""a worrying picture"", conservation group Save the Rhino International said, calling for more resources to be urgently deployed against poaching rings.

""There isn't an overnight solution, but with a rhino poached every 17 hours in South Africa, we can't afford to lose any more time,"" said Jo Shaw, the group's CEO.

The lion's share were poached in eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, with the Hluhluwe–Imfolozi park – Africa's oldest reserve – alone losing 307 animals, according to the government.

""This is the highest poaching loss within this province,"" said South Africa's Environment Minister Barbara Creecy. ""Multi-disciplinary teams continue to work tirelessly in an attempt to slow this relentless pressure.""

Hopes and concerns

In recent years authorities have tightened security, particularly around the Kruger National Park, a tourist magnet bordering Mozambique that has seen its rhino population fall drastically from more than 10,000 to less than 3,000 over the past 15 years.

This has resulted in lower losses there – 78 rhinos were killed in 2023, 37 percent fewer than in 2022.

But it has also pushed poachers towards regional and private reserves like Hluhluwe–Imfolozi.

Law enforcement agencies arrested 49 suspected poachers in KwaZulu-Natal last year, Creecy said.

Across the country, 45 poachers and horn traffickers were convicted in court, she added.

Among them was a former field ranger sentenced to 10 years behind bars for killing a rhino he later claimed had charged him.

As of 2023, the national parks authority requires new employees to take a lie detector test amid concerns that some workers might be in cahoots with poachers.

Rhino horns are highly sought after in black markets, where the price by weight rivals that of gold and cocaine.

Nevertheless, in September last year the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported that thanks to conservation efforts rhino numbers had grown across Africa.

Nearly 23,300 specimens roamed the continent at the end of 2022, up 5.2 percent on 2021, IUCN said, adding the increase was the first bit of ""good news"" for the animals in over a decade.

About 15,000 live in South Africa, according to a separate estimate by the International Rhino Foundation.

""While these updated IUCN population figures provide hope, these gains remain tenuous as long as the poaching crisis continues,"" Jeff Cooke of the World Wildlife Fund warned Tuesday.

And he described the spike in killings in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal, in particular, as ""of grave concern"".

Russia jails veteran activist Orlov of Nobel-winning Memorial rights group,"A Russian court on Tuesday sentenced top human rights campaigner Oleg Orlov to two and a half years in jail for denouncing Russia's assault on Ukraine.

Oleg Orlov, a Russian human rights campaigner and co-chair of the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial group charged with ""discrediting"" the Russian army, arrives in court for his verdict hearing in Moscow, Russia on February 27, 2024.

Advertising Read more

The 70-year-old, a key figure of the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial group, is the latest target of Kremlin repression, which has intensified since the offensive in Ukraine.

""The court has determined Orlov's guilt and orders a sentence of two years and six months... in a general regime penal colony,"" the judge said.

As the judge read the verdict, the bespectacled, white-haired activist winked at his wife, fellow activist Tatyana.

He was taken into custody in the courtroom and asked Tatyana to come over.

""Tanya, you promised me!"" he told her as she appeared to tear up.

Around 200 supporters were waiting in the corridor outside the courtroom to bid him goodbye.

Orlov had told AFP in a recent interview that he held no illusions on the outcome of the trial.

Orlov was accused of discrediting the Russian army in a column written for the French online publication Mediapart, and fined in October after a first trial.

The fine was a relatively lenient punishment and prosecutors called for a new trial.

Even as other campaigners fled the growing repression, Orlov remained in Russia, where he said he was ""more useful"" than abroad.

He told AFP that his career spent working on the historical memory of Soviet crimes and rights abuses in modern Russia -- especially in the North Caucasus -- gave him no choice but to also campaign against the Ukraine offensive.

Memorial established itself as a key pillar of Russian civil society by preserving the memory of victims of communist repression and by campaigning against rights violations.

The organisation was officially disbanded by Russian authorities in late 2021 and it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 alongside a leading Ukrainian rights group and a veteran Belarusian activist.

Hungary approves Sweden's NATO bid after months of blocking membership,"Hungary’s parliament voted Monday to ratify Sweden's bid to join NATO, bringing an end to more than 18 months of delays that have frustrated the alliance as it seeks to expand in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses a parliament session, on the day lawmakers are expected to approve Sweden's accession into NATO, in Budapest, Hungary on February 26, 2024.

Advertising Read more

The vote, which passed with 188 votes for and six against, came as a culmination of months of wrangling by Hungary's allies to convince its nationalist government to lift its block on Sweden's membership. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán submitted the protocols for approving Sweden's entry into NATO in July 2022, but the matter had stalled in parliament over opposition by governing party lawmakers.

Unanimous support among all NATO members is required to admit new countries, and Hungary is the last of the alliance’s 31 members to give its backing since Turkey ratified the request last month.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson called it “a historic day.""

Read moreSweden's call for population to prepare for war sparks panic and criticism

“We stand ready to shoulder our share of the responsibility for NATO’s security,” Kristersson wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Orbán, a right-wing populist who has forged close ties with Russia, has said that criticism of Hungary's democracy by Swedish politicians had soured relations between the two countries and led to reluctance among lawmakers in his Fidesz party.

But the vote on Monday removed the final membership hurdle for Sweden which, along with neighboring Finland, first applied to join the alliance in May 2022, just a few months after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Addressing lawmakers before the vote, Orbán said: “Sweden and Hungary’s military cooperation and Sweden’s NATO accession strengthen Hungary’s security.”

Orbán criticized Hungary's European Union and NATO allies for placing increased pressure on his government in recent months to move forward on bringing Sweden into the alliance.

“Several people tried to intervene from the outside in the settling of our disputes (with Sweden), but this did not help but rather hampered the issue,"" Orbán said. ""Hungary is a sovereign country, it does not tolerate being dictated to by others, whether it be the content of its decisions or their timing.”

Last weekend, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators visited Hungary and announced it would submit a joint resolution to Congress condemning Hungary’s alleged democratic backsliding and urging Orbán’s government to immediately lift its block on Sweden’s trans-Atlantic integration.

But on Friday, Ulf Kristersson, Sweden's prime minister, met with Orbán in Hungary's capital where they appeared to reach a decisive reconciliation after months of diplomatic tensions.

Following their meeting, the leaders announced the conclusion of a defense industry agreement that will include Hungary's purchase of four Swedish-made JAS 39 Gripen jets and the extension of a service contract for its existing Gripen fleet.

Orbán said the additional fighter jets “will significantly increase our military capabilities and further strengthen our role abroad” and will improve Hungary’s ability to participate in joint NATO operations.

“To be a member of NATO together with another country means we are ready to die for each other,” Orbán said. “A deal on defense and military capacities helps to reconstruct the trust between the two countries.”

Monday's vote on Sweden's NATO accession was just one matter on a busy agenda for lawmakers in the Hungarian parliament. A vote was also held on accepting the resignation of President Katalin Novák, who stepped down earlier this month in a scandal over her decision to pardon a man convicted of covering up a string of child sexual abuses.

After accepting Novák's resignation, lawmakers are expected to confirm Tamás Sulyok, the president of Hungary's Constitutional Court, as the country's new president. He is set to formally take office on March 5.

Some opposition parties have said they will not participate in a vote to confirm a new president and have called for direct presidential elections. But Sulyok was nominated by Orbán's Fidesz party, which has a two-thirds majority in parliament and is expected to easily approve his presidency.

A presidential signature is needed to formally endorse the approval of Sweden's NATO bid, which is expected within the next few days.

Macron not ruling out Western troops on the ground in Ukraine,"French President Emmanuel Macron announced Monday new steps to boost Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, saying not even the sending of Western ground troops was ruled out to achieve Europe's goal of defeating Moscow.

Advertising Read more

Speaking after hosting a meeting of two dozen European leaders to discuss Ukraine, Macron painted a grim picture of a Russia whose positions he said were ""hardening"" both at home and on the battlefield.

""We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensible to security and stability in Europe,"" he said.

Russia, he said, was showing a ""more aggressive attitude not just in Ukraine but in general"".

While there was ""no consensus"" on the sending of Western ground troops to Ukraine, ""nothing should be excluded. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,"" he said.

He refused to say more about France's position, citing the need for ""strategic ambiguity"" but saying the issue was mentioned among the ""options"".

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was quoted as saying some EU and NATO members were weighing the option.

""Many people who say 'never, ever' today were the same people who said 'never tanks, never planes, never long-range missiles' two years ago"" when Russia invaded, said Macron. ""Let us have the humility to note that we have often been six to twelve months late.""

'More and quicker'

Macron said the new coalition would be set up to supply Ukraine with ""missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes"".

There was a ""broad consensus to do more and quicker"", he added, saying there was also a consensus to ramp up joint production of armaments with Ukraine and boost its own military industry.

Czech Premier Petr Fiala meanwhile said there was ""great support"" for an initiative to help Ukraine buy munitions outside the EU. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his country would contribute and others would follow.

""Nothing can be excluded to achieve our objective. Russia cannot win that war,"" said Macron.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda were among around 25 European heads of state and government at the conference.

Other states sent ministers, with foreign secretary David Cameron in Paris for Britain, and the United States and Canada were also represented.

As he opened the conference at the Elysee Palace, Macron said that Ukraine's allies needed to jump-start their support as the war entered its third year.

""We have seen hardening on the part of Russia, especially these past few months,"" Macron said.

He said this had ""cruelly"" manifested in the death on February 16 of President Vladimir Putin's top opponent Alexei Navalny, but also in a hardening of Russia's positions on the front lines, where it was planning ""new attacks"".

Make a 'leap'

Macron said a ""leap"" was needed from the West in its approach that ""takes into account the transformation of the threat from a military and strategic point of view"".

The conference signalled Macron's eagerness to present himself as a European champion of Ukraine's cause, amid growing fears that American support could wane in the coming months.

""Together we must ensure that Putin cannot destroy our achievements and cannot expand his aggression to other nations,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a brief video message to the conference.

Western officials acknowledge that Russia risks gaining the upper hand in the conflict this year as Ukraine runs out of weapons and ammunition.

Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Sunday that half of the Western military aid pledged to Kyiv is delivered late, noting that ""commitment does not constitute delivery"".

Zelensky complained Ukraine only received 30 percent of a million shells the EU had promised. ""It is clear that we did not have this million,"" Macron said, acknowledging an ""imprudent commitment"".

There are growing doubts about the viability of long-term US backing for Ukraine as a new aid package struggles to find legislative approval and Donald Trump, who has indicated opposition to further support for Kyiv, eyes a return to the presidency in elections this year.

An estimated 900 tractors brought the city's European quarter to a halt -- for the second time in a month -- with farmers hurling eggs, burning tyres and setting off fireworks while officers fired water cannon and tear gas to press them back.

While the day saw no serious clashes, it represented a new show of force in the Europe-wide farmers' movement, spurred by what are seen as excessive EU environmental requirements and unfairly cheap imports.

Agriculture ministers from the 27-nation bloc were in Brussels to examine proposals for simplifying the EU's much-maligned Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) -- in a new attempt to try to assuage farmers.

But for the protesters in Brussels -- who came from Spain, Portugal and Italy as well as Belgium -- none of it felt like enough.

""It's their responsibility to talk to us,"" said Marieke Van de Vivere, who came to protest against green regulations she says are strangling her family farm.

""When our horse poops, we have to tell them how much it poops, we have to pay for the horse that poops, we have to tell them what happens with the poop of the horse -- where it goes, what day.""

""It's too crazy to explain,"" she said.

Adoracion Blanque, of the Spanish young farmers association, had a similar message.

""There are so many demands and bureaucracy that we farmers cannot continue producing,"" she told AFP.

The rolling farmer protests -- which saw French President Emmanuel Macron angrily heckled over the weekend -- have unnerved EU leaders concerned they could prove a boon for the far-right at European elections in June.

Brussels has given ground with a string of concessions in recent weeks.

These include an extended suspension of rules on leaving land fallow, and safeguards to stop Ukrainian imports flooding the market under a tariff-free scheme introduced after Russia's 2022 invasion.

In the short term, the latest European Commission proposals could further lift environmental constraints by easing demands for former livestock farmers to convert their land into grassland.

The commission also envisions cutting the number of on-site farm inspections by 50 percent, and granting leeway to farmers who fail to meet CAP requirements because of extreme weather.

'Bureaucratic monster'

Beyond that, Brussels has opened the door to a possible medium-term revision of the CAP, to be negotiated with lawmakers and member states, with a view to cutting more red tape.

Right now ""we need something practical, something operational,"" France's agriculture minister Marc Fesneau told reporters upon arrival, arguing there is room for adjustments ""within the current rules.""

But he said meeting some demands ""would require changing the legislation.""

""Whether that happens before or after the European elections does not matter -- what matters is moving forward,"" he said.

Germany's agriculture minister, Cem Ozdemir, acknowledged ""there is a lot of anger faced with promises that have not been kept.""

""The current CAP is a bureaucratic monster,"" he said, calling for reforms to encourage ""working the land rather than paperwork.""

Elsewhere in Europe, the protest movement simmered on with thousands of Spanish farmers rallying outside the agriculture ministry in Madrid, holding placards that read: ""The countryside is in the abyss and the government doesn't care.""

Maria Villoslada Garcia, a 43-year-old winegrower from northern Spain, told AFP: ""We expect solutions, but quickly"" from the EU and Spain ""because we are being suffocated"" and ""our work costs more than what it pays.""

Paris organisers cast doubt on holding Olympic swimming events in the Seine,"Organisers of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris may be feeling a little queasy over their commitment to hold open water swimming in the scenic but often polluted Seine.

Open-water swimming at the Paris Olympics will take place in the Seine which has been closed to bathers since 1923.

Advertising Read more

Last August, the marathon swimming test events were cancelled because the water was too dirty, as were the swimming legs on two of the four days of triathlon and para-triathlon tests.

The city of Paris has insisted ""there is no plan B"".

The course for the men's and women's 10-kilometre events will start at the iconic beaux-art Pont Alexandre-III and, with the Invalides and Eiffel Tower in the background, head 1km down river past other famed attractions, including the Musee d'Orsay, and the Grand Palais.

Perhaps appropriately, it passes the newly-renovated Paris Sewer Museum and the more minimalist Pont d'Alma before looping back. The triathlon swims are shorter and will turn back sooner.

It is a route chosen to showcase the beauty of Paris.

It is also politically symbolic: swimming has been banned in the Seine since 1923 but various Paris mayors have vowed to open it up.

In 1990, when he was mayor before becoming French president, Jacques Chirac promised the river would ""soon"" be clean enough in which to swim and that he would celebrate by taking a dip. He never did.

The current mayor, Anne Hidalgo, a vigorous promoter of green initiatives, has also promised she will take the plunge before the Olympics start and that the public will be allowed to swim at three locations by 2025. She has yet to get her feet wet.

City officials argue that the quality of the water has improved, but none of the samples collected between June and September 2023 met European standards on the minimum quality of water for swimming.

The big problem is faecal matter. The bacteria in the water increases sharply when heavy rain sweeps debris and untreated wastewater into the river from the banks and the overflowing drains and sewers.

The city tests the water at 14 points. In 2022, water quality at three of them was judged to be ""sufficient"" but had deteriorated by last summer.

The open-water swimming last August was cancelled after heavy rain sent E. coli readings to six times the target level set by World Aquatics (FINA).

The city of Paris insisted they had ""learnt"" from the sampling problems at the test events.

National and local authorities are also investing 1.4 billion euros (more than $1.5bn) in five projects designed to clean the water.

'Valve malfunction'

According to a Paris city official, the failed tests for the team triathlon and, two weeks later, the para triathlon swimming were caused not by rain but by a ""valve malfunction"" in the Paris sewage system.

The weather remains the ""main risk"", acknowledges the Paris town hall, which fears ""exceptional rainfall"".

The only backup plan for the swimming is postponing the events by a few days.

""There is no solution to move the event, the triathlon and open water swimming will be held in the Seine next year,"" Tony Estanguet, Paris 2024 organising committee, said after the cancellations last August.

For the athletes these are the Olympics and dirty water is a constant risk in open-water competitions.

At the end of the test event in 2019 ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, swimmers protested against the quality of the water in Tokyo Bay. Before the Rio Olympics in 2016, the polluted Guanabara Bay made headlines.

'Glittering setting'

""A glittering setting,"" Italian double world champion Gregorio Paltrinieri told Italian media in January. ""Even if the water is dirty, I would rather swim in an electric atmosphere in the centre of Paris than in an anonymous stretch of water.""

After winning silver at the world championships in Qatar earlier in February, Frenchman Marc-Antoine Olivier said he was excited by the venue.

""People may be afraid of what's in the water, but swimming in a historic place is going to be incredible,"" he said. ""Of course, a lot of people are going to try and create a bit of a buzz about the conditions we're going to have in the water, but if we can swim then there's no problem. They won't take the risk of us swimming and someone catching something.""

The triathlons could become 'duathlons' as some did last summer.

""It would be a shame but we adapted to a duathlon,"" said Briton Beth Potter, who won the individual test event.

Protesting French farmers clash with police as Macron visits Paris agriculture fair,"French President Emmanuel Macron spent the entire day at the annual agricultural fair Saturday, as angry farmers heckled him and scuffled with police.

French President Emmanuel Macron (C) gestures as he speaks with French farmers members of the agricultural unions National Federation of Agricultural Holders' Unions (FNSEA), Young Farmers (JA), Rural Coordination (CR) during the opening day of the 60th International Agriculture Fair (Salon de l'Agriculture), in Paris, on February 24, 2024

Riot police kept the protesters at a safe distance as Macron toured the fair, inspecting prize cattle, tasting honey from Normandy and cheeses from the Alps, and shaking hands with exhibitors.

But as he entered the fair’s livestock area in the morning, hundreds of protestors crashed the gates and clashed with police.

In the ensuing confusion, the fair was repeatedly closed and then re-opened to the public.

Throughout the day, police and protestors pushed each other back and forth in chaotic scenes.

Police arrested six people and eight officers were hurt in the violence, the head of the Paris force, Laurent Nunez, said Saturday.

In a separate incident, farmers poured manure on the stand of dairy giant Lactalis, which they accuse of not paying enough for its milk.

“Who would have said this morning that 12 hours later we’d still be working and advancing,” Macron said at around 8:00 pm.

“It’s ridiculous that a small number of farmers spread violence at their own fair,” he added. He finally left around 9:00 pm -- 13 hours after he arrived.

Macron meets farmers’ leaders

While French presidents have often been jeered at the annual fair, Saturday’s scenes were a first.

Farmers’ leaders had warned Macron that his visit to the “Salon de l’Agriculture”—a fixture of the presidential calendar—would not go smoothly if the government had not delivered on their promises to meet their demands.

He had begun the day at the fair with an early morning two-hour meeting with the leaders of the three main farmers unions, the FNSEA, Jeunes Agriculteurs and Coordination Rurale.

Standing at plastic table, his jacket off and shirt sleeves rolled up, the president listened to complaints about prices, red tape and state aid.

It was a step down from the major national debate he had originally planned before scrapping it after a row over who could be invited.

“I always prefer dialogue to confrontation,” Macron said. “I am telling you that work is being done on the ground, we are in the process of simplifying things.”

Macron stressed that his government had made 62 commitments to meet farmers demands, including promises of minimum prices for some agricultural commodities.

The protesting farmers were not impressed.

“Did you hear him? He doesn’t let us speak, he talks down to us. We want him to go,” farmer Eric Labarre, an FNSEA member, told AFP.

FNSEA leader Arnaud Rousseau was more conciliatory. “There are a certain number of advances that we are happy about,” he told LCI television.

Macron said he would meet again with farmers in three weeks, after the fair shuts on March 3.

Scientists crack mystery of how baleen whales sing underwater,"Whales sing loud enough that their songs travel through the ocean, but knowing the mechanics behind that has been a mystery. Scientists now think they have an idea, and it's something not seen in other animals: a specialized voice box.

Experts say the discovery, while based on a study that is too tiny to be definitive, will direct future research into how whales communicate.

In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Coen Elemans of the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues studied the voice boxes, or larynxes, from three dead, stranded whales — a humpback, minke and sei, which are all types of baleen whales.

In the laboratory, the scientists blew air through the voice boxes under controlled conditions to see what tissues might vibrate. Researchers also created computer models of the sei whale’s vocalizations and matched them to recordings of similar whales taken in the wild.

Whales' ancestors were land-dwellers about 50 million years ago before moving into water. Elemans said the animals adapted their voice boxes over tens of millions of years to make sounds underwater.

Unlike humans and other mammals, baleen whales don't have teeth or vocal chords. Instead, in their voice boxes, they have a U-shaped tissue that allows them to breathe in massive amounts of air and a large “cushion” of fat and muscle not seen in other animal species. Whales sing by pushing the tissue against the fat and muscle cushion, Elemans said.

“This is the most comprehensive and significant study to date on how baleen whales vocalize, a long-standing mystery in the field,” said Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor of oceans at Stanford University, who was not involved in the new research.

He noted there is more to be studied ""given the extraordinarily diverse acoustic repertoires” of whales. Humpbacks, for example, are known to compose elaborate songs that travel across oceans and whale pods.

As loud as whales' songs are, modelling suggests that humpbacks and related species can’t produce sounds louder than the shipping industry, Elemans said.

“They’re really affected by (shipping noise) and it significantly reduces their ability to communicate,” he said. “There’s just no way for them to get louder.”

Because some whales sing as a mating call, the shipping industry’s interruption of those songs is potentially worrying, said Michael Noad, director of the Centre for Marine Science at the University of Queensland in Australia. He was not part of the Nature study.

“For whale populations that are really dispersed, like the Antarctic blue whales, they might not be able to find mates in a noisy ocean environment,” he said, noting that whale species like humpbacks that gather in big numbers are more likely to shrug off such noise pollution.

The whale voice boxes tested were from juveniles, not adult males, who do the singing. Because of that, whale expert Joy Reidenberg said, further experiments on adult males are needed to confirm the study's findings.

But Reidenberg, who works for the Center for Anatomy and Functional Morphology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, noted that lab research is probably as close as we can get to replicating how whales sing.

“Right now, our technology involves sticking a scope into a whale to see what exactly is vibrating,” she said. “Since you’re never going to be able to do that in a wild animal, these experiments are the next best thing.”

Burundi: innovative solutions to fight stunting in children,"Child malnutrition is considered a silent emergency. In Burundi, recent research has shown than more than half of children are affected by stunting. It is imperative to act, which is why the government of Burundi, supported by UNICEF and other partners, is determined to take resolute and collective action, rooted in local innovations based on a multisectoral approach.

Ten years ago, Burundi began taking a multisectoral approach, which has gradually been consolidated since the country joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in 2013. A Multisectoral Food and Nutrition Security Platform was put in place in 2019, bringing together various stakeholders. Its aim is to coordinate interventions in the key sectors contributing to the fight against child malnutrition, as well as all the stakeholders and partners concerned.

The partners come from the fields of health, education, access to water, hygiene and sanitation, of course, but also from the agriculture, social protection, governance and gender mainstreaming sectors, as explained by Doctor Célestin Sibomana, Permanent Executive Secretary of the platform : “The increase in agricultural production takes the intensification of agriculture into account through, for example: the pooling of land to obtain larger farmable areas; the identification and use of state-owned lands; the set-up and financing of communal cooperatives by the government to the tune of 20 million Burundian Francs per communal cooperative and per year; and the launch and funding of the Youth Investment Bank and the Investment and Development Bank, which finances women’s mixed farming projects.”

As part of its commitment to children’s well-being, UNICEF is one of the multisectoral platform’s major partners. In particular, to enable households with children under the age of 5 to access varied diets, the organisation participates in the set-up of vegetable patches and supports livestock farming and fortified flour production programmes. To guarantee their impact, these actions are part of the collaboration with the private sector and the other food and nutritional safety stakeholders.

The power of collaboration

The fight against stunting in children relies on collaboration between the government and international institutions; however, first and foremost, it is rooted in solutions that have been developed locally, with the population itself. Thus, in Learning and Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres, so-called “mamans lumières” (“Light Mothers”) guide other parents in preparing balanced meals. These mothers are first identified within their communities because of their good practices with regard to their children’s health and are then trained to support the other mothers. This government initiative, supported by UNICEF since 2013, is aimed at rehabilitating the moderate cases of malnutrition identified during regularly organised mass screenings.

“UNICEF does not directly carry out the interventions it supports; among other things, it collaborates with the government and local and international organisations, with a view to reinforcing their capacities in setting up food and nutritional safety projects and thus ensuring the longevity of the actions,” explains France Bégin, UNICEF Representative in Burundi.

This is the case, for example, with the thousand-plus solidarity groups put in place by UNICEF with the support of different financial partners, including the European Union, the Netherlands, and the coordination between the Swiss and German governments. In many Burundian communes, the inhabitants - particularly pregnant and breastfeeding mothers - form solidarity groups to strengthen household resilience, through savings and credit, but also thanks to the promotion of good eating habits.

It is by harnessing key resources at a local level, through innovation and collaboration, that the government, UNICEF and all the stakeholders can effectively fight malnutrition and write a new narrative for the children of Burundi.

Child malnutrition in Burundi: concrete actions to help children,"The editorial team did not contribute to this article in any way.

Burundi has a very high potential for food self-sufficiency. However, with a population of 13 million inhabitants (INSBU 2023 projections), almost half of whom are under the age of 18, the Eastern African country has been affected by chronic child malnutrition for several decades.

Unlike acute malnutrition, which happens quickly and requires immediate treatment to prevent death, chronic malnutrition occurs over the long term. Its main consequence is stunting, which “​​holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and is one of the challenges facing certain countries, including Burundi.

“Acute malnutrition seems to be under control in Burundi, at a rate of around 4.8%.The challenge remains stunting,” as confirmed by Doctor Célestin Sibomana, Permanent Executive Secretary of the Multisectoral Food and Nutrition Security Platform, Office of the Prime Minister.

The latest nutritional survey conducted in Burundi (SMART, 2022) showed that 56% of children under the age of 5 suffer from stunting, which is well above the critical threshold of 30% set by the WHO. Beyond the nutritional emergency, the consequences can be seen over the long term, with “socio-emotional and neurophysiological development problems that may lead to harmful effects on health, learning, future productivity and on the economy of their communities and their nations,” explains France Bégin, UNICEF Representative in Burundi.

Burundi has already realised that stunting is a complex problem with many causes: on the one hand, the low standard of living for households does not allow access to sufficient dietary diversity. On the other hand, hygiene conditions, difficulties in accessing drinking water, lack of quality care and services for mothers and their children, and poor eating habits all combine to maintain a vicious circle that Burundi is determined to break by changing the status quo through multisectoral interventions.

Taking action for the health, good nutrition and development of children

To reverse the trend, UNICEF backs government initiatives by being involved and active in both malnutrition prevention and the appropriate treatment of proven cases: “In 2023, for example, thanks to UNICEF’s support, around 1,200,000 children aged from 6 to 59 months were able to receive 2 doses of vitamin A supplements and undergo deworming, while 500,000 children under 2 received multiple micronutrient powders.In addition, over 500,000 breastfeeding mothers and people who look after children will receive specific advice on food and care for infants and young children, as well on good hygiene and sanitation practices,” specifies France Bégin. In parallel to these efforts, 247,382 women have benefited from services to prevent anaemia and other forms of malnutrition, while 75,950 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition received adequate quality care.

Health, however, is not the only way to prevent stunting, which is why UNICEF is participating in multisectoral efforts undertaken by the government of Burundi, including the promotion of agriculture and livestock farming; the implementation of local food system initiatives aimed at improving dietary diversity among children; education; social protection; and access to water and hygiene.

UNICEF is also helping the Burundian government to draft and revise standard documents for nutrition, while providing precious support in conducting nutritional surveys, such as SMART, which inform Burundi’s nutritional policies and strategies.

The focus is this necessity: to follow an action plan encompassing all sectors and involving all local stakeholders in order to strengthen their capacities for action, and to build a future in which each and every Burundian child may flourish.

The CAC 40 in the era of climate change,"The editorial team did not contribute to this article in any way.

There is now no denying the devastating impact of climate change on our planet. Faced with this alarming reality, France’s major corporations have committed to policies and crucial actions to deal with it.

The figures revealed in the “Climat : CAC degrés de trop (Climate: CAC degrees too many)” report prepared by Oxfam France are a cause for concern. This report estimates the carbon footprint of the CAC 40 companies at 4.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a quantity which, if sustained, could lead to a global temperature increase of 3.5°C by 2100.

On LinkedIn, Fabrice Bonnifet, Environment Group Director at Bouygues, sounds the alarm with regard to carbon reduction policies he deems inefficient: “If we want to get out of the climate crisis, we must immediately and drastically reduce our carbon footprint and restore as many natural carbon sinks as possible.""

This climate crisis is now acknowledged by an overwhelming majority, starting with the CAC 40 companies, which are key stakeholders in this energy transition. They were all gathered at the “La REF” (The Meeting of French Entrepreneurs) show, an event for entrepreneurs organised by the MEDEF confederation, where action was the watchword!

In an interview she gave on her arrival at the show, Isabelle Spiegel, Environment Director at the Vinci Group, said, “We don't have any more time to wait. Thinking about 2050 is really too far away.”

This urgency is palpable at all levels of our society. It is felt by individuals, governments and, of course, companies. This is why the large corporations now have clear environmental roadmaps focused on 2030. In other words, tomorrow!

“We have clear commitments to increase the share of renewable energy in our energy consumption to 70% by 2030”, explained Frederick Jeske-Schoenhoven, Director of Strategy and Sustainable Development at SUEZ, at a conference he attended. “We're the first generation to experience climate change and, at the same time, we're the last generation able to limit its impact.”

At the end of the LaREF conferences, the conversations were lively and consensus of the major corporations on environmental issues was unequivocal. Their commitment will be key to bringing our societies back from the brink of the climate abyss and reigniting the dream of a better future.

Only one in four Africans has access to a safe source of drinking water*, according to the UN. This figure highlights the scale of the water scarcity crisis that Africa is facing today.

As climate change continues to exacerbate water scarcity, a series of new startups in Africa are coming up with innovative technologies in a bid to address the situation.

These initiatives include the Franco-Tunisian Kumulus project. Kumulus aims to supply machines that produce drinking water in remote areas in Africa. These machines harvest moisture from the atmosphere and convert it to drinking water. Indeed, it is estimated that the atmosphere contains around six times as much water as all the rivers in the world**, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.

The Kumulus smart machine looks like an amphora and weighs roughly 60 kilos, making it easy to transport in a pick-up truck and easy to install. It produces up to 30 litres of drinking water every day and can be connected to electrical grids or to solar panels in remote areas of Africa. This machine should enable local populations to live independently with their own drinking water source.

""In addition to capturing moisture from the air, we treat the collected water with multiple filters, add mineral salts to make it safe for consumption, and then pass it through a UV filter just before it comes out of the tap to kill off the bacteria,"" explains Abid Mohamed Ali, co-founder of the Franco-Tunisian project based in Tunis, Paris and Madrid. ""We have placed sensors throughout the machine to receive data and adjust the water treatment based on the air quality.""

In June 2023, the Kumulus project placed its first four solar-powered amphorae in an elementary school in Bazma, in the governorate of Kebili, Tunisia. With the support of governments, development banks, and private sector partners, Kumulus has the potential to be a game-changer for millions of people.

For Iheb Triki, cofounder of the company, Kumulus’s potential is endless***: ""My dream is that every family can have its own water source, a sustainable source, its own Kumulus. We are getting there.""

The African continent is coming together and developing its innovation ecosystem more and more. The African Development Bank is supporting African countries and mobilising the private sector to finance green growth in Africa.

YouthADAPT program: Empowering African youth to address climate change,"The editorial team did not contribute to this article in any way.

The AfDB’s 2023 Annual Meetings took place in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt in May. The YouthADAPT program showcases the organisation’s commitment to provide funding and support for youth-led climate change adaptation and resilience projects across Africa.

With 60% of its inhabitants under 25 years old, Africa possesses the youngest population on the planet. Fostering the creative and innovative minds of Africa’s youth to help combat climate change and take the continent to the next level is one of the main goals of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) today.

Climate change is a pressing global issue, and Africa is among the regions most vulnerable to its impacts. The AfDB recognises the urgency of addressing climate change on the continent and is taking action through its YouthADAPT program. Since its inception in 2020, the program has so far supported 35 youth-led enterprises in 14 African countries with $3.5 million to drive climate actions in various sectors.

A Pillar of the African Adaptation Acceleration Program

The YouthADAPT Program is one of the four core pillars of the African Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) which aims to strengthen the production of youth-led or owned small to medium sized enterprises to increase climate resilience and boost job opportunities. It aims to empower African youth to address climate change by supporting innovative ideas and projects – in renewable energy, water management or agriculture and food security – that promote climate change adaptation and resilience.

For the Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate & Green Growth at The African Development Bank: “The youth are very innovative, very creative, so they can be at the forefront of trying to help Africa adapt to the impact of climate change.”

The program focuses on supporting projects in five key areas: water management, agriculture and food security, renewable energy, sustainable cities and urbanization, and climate-related disasters. By providing funding and technical assistance, the YouthADAPT program is helping to create job opportunities and support economic development on the continent.

Triggering change through the YouthADAPT program

And the program is already making a difference in communities across the continent. One example is Agritech Analysis, led by Maryanne Gichanga, its CEO and co-founder. The company aims to put an end to famine, which threatens at least 21 million people in East Africa.

The company uses a crop and soil management tool that leverages AI-powered satellite analytics and IoT sensors (connected devices that detect changes in an environment and collect data) to help small-scale farmers detect and predict the weather, crop pests and diseases, and soil health.

The company is currently working with 2,879 small-scale farmers who reside in the Rift Valley, Central and Eastern parts of Kenya. Their goal is to reach 15,000 small-scale farmers in 20 countries by the end of 2023.

For Maryanne Gichanga, the program helps to improve their business skills, gives access to funding, offers networking opportunities and confers exposure and recognition. She thinks that “the Youth Adapt Program represents a critical opportunity for Africa's young people to play a leading role in shaping their own futures and building a more sustainable world for generations to come.”

The AfDB has been supporting dozens of projects like this one across Africa, providing an opportunity to channel the creativity of the continent's young minds to create a more sustainable future for everyone.

The program, whose winners were announced during COP27, is a practical demonstration of how to promote green growth through private-led initiatives, which is the theme of the African Development Bank's 2023 Annual Meetings: Mobilizing Private Sector Financing for Climate and Green Growth in Africa #AfDBAM2023.

AfDB's strategic efforts in mobilising private investment for green growth,"The editorial team did not contribute to this article in any way.

The AfDB’s 2023 Annual Meetings took place in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt in May. The organisation has embarked on various initiatives to mobilise and leverage private sector resources. By harnessing the power of partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms, the bank is paving the way for a greener future in Africa.

Africa is poised to experience the second-fastest economic growth in the world, trailing only Asia, according to the 2023 African Economic Outlook report by the African Development Bank (AfDB). The report emphasises that this projected growth hinges on favourable global conditions and the continent's ability to enhance its economic resilience.

Released during the Bank's annual meetings in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, the 2023 Outlook anticipates Africa's GDP growth to reach 4.3% in 2024, up from 3.8% in 2022, and highlights that 22 countries are expected to achieve growth rates exceeding 5%.

The Bank Group’s Annual Meetings, which ended on Friday evening, allowed the Bank’s Board of Governors, African leaders and development partners to explore the practical ways of “mobilising private sector financing for climate and green growth in Africa”, this year’s theme. The Board has also approved management’s request to leverage the equity of the African Development Fund to mobilise more resources on the capital markets. When fully implemented, the Bank Group could unlock up to $27 billion to help low-income and fragile states through the Group’s concessional lending arm, the African Development Fund.

To attract private investors and encourage their participation in green projects, the AfDB has developed innovative financing mechanisms. One such initiative is the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), which provides grants and technical assistance to support the development of renewable energy projects.

“African economies are moving in the right direction,” said AfDB’s President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, noting that five of the six pre-pandemic top-performing economies are set to be back in the league of the world’s 10 fastest-growing economies in 2023–2024.

The Success Story of the Benban Solar Park

The Benban Solar Park in Egypt serves as a remarkable example of mobilising the private sector for renewable energy development. Located near the city of Aswan, the Benban Solar Park extends over an area of 37 square kilometres and is one of the world's largest solar energy installations.

“The first time I came here, there was nothing but sand. Benban is now one of the largest solar parks in the world, with millions of photovoltaic panels, providing electricity to more than one million homes,” said Mostafa Adelfatah, the project manager.

This project is part of the strategy developed by the Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Authority, and the AfDB supported the project by bringing in investors such as Africa50. The investment platform acted as a bridge between the government and the private sector, and helped leverage around $450 million dollars into the Solar Park.

The Bank is committed to mobilising $25 billion by 2025 and wants to pave the way for a greener, more prosperous Africa but also go further: reducing the level of policy instruments and promoting inclusion and better coordination among multilateral development banks is the challenge of years to come.

On the independence of Africa, the governor of the central Bank of Egypt, former Chairperson, said : ”We need to work together in order to have our own funds, to make sure that the perception of our economies is closer to the reality, rather than being framed because of failures that are not of our doing.”

A deal between Israel and Hamas appears to be taking shape. What would it look like?,"CAIRO (AP) — Israel and Hamas are inching toward a new deal that would free some of the roughly 130 hostages held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for a weekslong pause in the war, now in its fifth month.

U.S. President Joe Biden says a deal could go into effect as early as Monday, ahead of what is seen as an unofficial deadline — the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, around March 10.

A deal would bring some respite to desperate people in Gaza, who have borne a staggering toll, as well as to the anguished families of Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war.

Here is a look at the emerging agreement.

OUTLINE OF THE DEAL

According to a senior official from Egypt, a six-week cease-fire would go into effect, and Hamas would agree to free up to 40 hostages — mostly civilian women, at least two children, and older and sick captives. Israel would release at least 300 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, the official said.

Israel would also allow displaced Palestinians to return to certain areas in northern Gaza, which was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive and suffered widespread destruction, according to the official from Egpyt, which is mediating the deal along with the U.S. and Qatar.

The Egyptian official said aid deliveries would be ramped up during the cease-fire, with 300 to 500 trucks entering the beleaguered territory per day, far more than the daily average number of trucks entering since the start of the war.

The deliveries to areas across Gaza would be facilitated by Israel, whose forces would refrain from attacks on them and on police escorting the aid convoys, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the talks with journalists.

STICKING POINTS

Despite Biden’s optimism, both sides continue to posture ahead of any final agreement even as talks continue in Qatar. Both Israeli and Hamas officials downplayed any sense of progress.

Israel and Hamas have been far apart on their terms for a deal in the past, dragging out negotiations that appeared to have momentum.

Israel wants all female soldiers included in the first phase of hostage releases, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing talks. Hamas views all soldiers as more significant bargaining chips and is likely to press back on this demand. The Egyptian official said the female soldiers were at this point being held off until after the first release.

The Egyptian official said the sides also are discussing how many Palestinians would be allowed to return to northern Gaza and whether to limit their return to women and men over 50.

Talks are also pinning down which areas of Gaza that Israel would withdraw troops from, the Egyptian official said, adding that Israel wants Hamas to refrain from using those it left as staging grounds for attacks. It also wants Hamas to stop firing rockets at southern Israel. Hamas has so far rejected both demands, the official said.

The emerging deal leaves a door open for Israel to operate in the southern border town of Rafah once it expires. More than half of Gaza’s population has fled to the southern city on the Egyptian border. Israel wants to destroy what it says are the few Hamas battalions left standing there.

WHAT REMAINS TO BE NEGOTIATED?

During the temporary cease-fire, both sides would negotiate toward an extension of the deal that the Egyptian official said would include the release of all the female soldiers in exchange for a higher number of imprisoned Palestinians, including those serving long sentences for deadly attacks.

After the female soldiers, Israel will seek to free male soldiers for whom Hamas will likely demand a high price. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed not to agree to a deal at any cost. But the families of the hostages, whose plight has deeply shaken Israelis, are likely to ramp up pressure if others are freed.

The U.S. hopes the new deal will be a launching pad for implementing its vision for a postwar Gaza that would eventually lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. It wants Gaza to be governed by a revamped Palestinian Authority, which administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. On Monday, it took a first step that could usher in U.S.-backed reforms by disbanding the self-rule government.

Israel wants to retain overall security control in the Gaza Strip and has rejected having world powers impose a state on it.

Many in Iran are frustrated by unrest and poor economy. Parliament elections could see a low turnout,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran is holding parliamentary elections this Friday, yet the real question may not be who gets elected but how many people actually turn out to vote.

Widespread discontent over the cratering economy, years of mass protests rocking the country, and tensions with the West over Tehran’s nuclear program and Iran’s support for Russia in its war on Ukraine have many people quietly saying they won’t vote in this election.

Officials have urged people to cast ballots but tellingly, no information has been released this year from the state-owned polling center ISPA about expected turnout — a constant feature of past elections. Of 21 Iranians interviewed recently by The Associated Press, only five said they would vote. Thirteen said they won’t and three said they were undecided.

“If I protest about some shortcoming, many police and security agents will try to stop me,” said Amin, a 21-year-old university student who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals. “But if I die from hunger on the corner of one of the main streets, they will show no reaction.”

Over 15,000 candidates are vying for a seat in the 290-member parliament, formally known as the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Terms runs for four years and five seats are reserved for Iran’s religious minorities.

Under the law, the parliament has oversight over the executive branch, votes on treaties and handles other issues. In practice, absolute power in Iran rests with its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Hard-liners have controlled the parliament for the past two decades — with chants of “Death to America” often heard from the floor.

Under parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Revolutionary Guard general who supported a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999, the legislature pushed forward a bill in 2020 that greatly curtailed Tehran’s cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

That followed then-President Donald Trump’s unilateral withdrawal of America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 — an act that sparked years of tensions in the Middle East and saw Iran enrich enough uranium at record-breaking purity to have enough fuel for “several” nuclear weapons if it chose.

More recently, the parliament has focused on issues surrounding Iran’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, for women after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which sparked nationwide protests.

The protests quickly escalated into calls to overthrow Iran’s clerical rulers. A subsequent security crackdown killed over 500 people, with more than 22,000 detained.

Calls for an election boycott have spread in recent weeks, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a women’s right activist, who called them a “sham.”

“The Islamic Republic, with its ruthless and brutal suppression, the killing of young people on the streets, the executions and the imprisonment and torture of men and women, deserves national sanctions and global disgrace,” Mohammadi said in a statement.

The boycott calls have put the government under renewed pressure — since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran’s theocracy has based its legitimacy in part on turnout in elections.

On Wednesday, Khamenei himself urged people to vote, describing it as a national duty. “There is no reasoning behind not voting,” he said. “It does not solve any problem of the country.”

He also said “those who express a lack of interest in the election and encourage others not to participate should think some more.”

“If the election is weak, all face harm,” he added.

Though ISPA, the polling agency, conducted election surveys in October, its results have not been made public. Figures from politicians and other media outlets suggest a turnout of around 30%.

In the 2021 presidential election that brought hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi to power, the turnout was 49% — the lowest on record for a presidential vote. Millions of ballots were declared void, likely from those who felt obligated to vote but did not want to cast a ballot.

The 2019 parliament race saw a 42% turnout.

Separately, Iranians will also vote on Friday for members of the country’s 88-seat Assembly of Experts, an eight-year term on a panel that will appoint the country’s next supreme leader after Khamenei, 84.

Barred from that race is former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate under whose term Iran struck the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Some who spoke to the AP said Iran’s economic woes were the reason they are staying away from the polls. Inflation is reportedly at around 50%, with unemployment around 20% for young Iranians.

“I will not vote,” said Hashem Amani, a 55-year-old fruit merchant in southern Tehran. “In 2021, I voted for Raisi to become president in hope that similar people in the government can work together and make a better life for me. What I got in return was rocketing prices for everything.”

Morteza, a 53-year-old taxi driver who gave just his first name fearing reprisals, also expressed disenchantment.

“Why should I vote?” he asked. “I voted many times in the past yet I am paying for schooling of my three daughters. ... I am still a renter and continuously I keep moving to a poorer area.”

Others, like 42-year-old Marzieh Moqaddam, insisted they would vote. She compared voting to a religious duty and insisted the country needs “to improve the Islamic culture, like the hijab.”

However, Abbas Kazemi, a 32-year-old bank clerk, offered a far different reason why he is heading to the polls — protecting Iran’s legislature from the influence of the hard-liners that have controlled it for decades.

“We have to keep the election alive, otherwise hard-liners will shut it down forever,” he said.",Resume122,[],2024-02-28 05:23:35,"['elections', 'low', 'nuclear', 'economy', 'irans', 'parliament', 'past', 'unrest', 'frustrated', 'young', 'iran', 'poor', 'vote', 'islamic', 'election', 'turnout']",ap_news_articles
Russia: Alexei Navalny's funeral will be held on Friday,"The funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died earlier this month in a remote Arctic penal colony, will take place on Friday in Moscow after several locations declined to host the service, his spokesperson said.

His funeral will be held at a church in Moscow’s southeast Maryino district on Friday afternoon, Kira Yarmysh said Wednesday. The burial is to be at a nearby cemetery.

Navalny died in mid-February in one of Russia’s harshest penal facilities. Russian authorities said the cause of his death at age 47 is still unknown, and the results of any investigation are likely to be questioned abroad. Many Western leaders have already said they hold Russian President Vladimir Putin responsible for his death.

Yarmysh spoke of the difficulties his team encountered in trying to find a site for a “farewell event” for Navalny.

AP AUDIO: The funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny will be on Friday, spokesperson says. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on plans to memorialize Navalny.

Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, she said most venues said they were fully booked, with some “refusing when we mention the surname ‘Navalny,” and one disclosing that “funeral agencies were forbidden to work with us.”

Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said the funeral was initially planned for Thursday –- the day of Putin’s annual address to Russia’s Federal Assembly -– but no venue would agree to hold it then.

“The real reason is clear. The Kremlin understands that nobody will need Putin and his message on the day we say farewell to Alexei,” Zhdanov wrote on Telegram.

In an interview with the independent Russian news site Meduza on Wednesday, Zhdanov said authorities were pressuring Navalny’s relatives to “have a quiet family funeral” and move the burial to the Khovanskoye cemetery on Moscow’s southwestern outskirts.

“They are again blackmailing relatives and saying: either hold a quiet family funeral, or nothing will really work out for you,” Zhdanov said.

He said Navalny’s lawyer, Vasily Dubkov, who helped Navalny’s mother retrieve her son’s body, was briefly detained on Tuesday “as some kind of suspicious person” when he went to visit the morgue, where Zhdanov said there currently is a strong police presence.

Zhadov declined to comment on the circumstances of Navalny’s death, but repeated claims by close Navalny associate Maria Pevchikh that there had been negotiations for a possible prisoner exchange involving Navalny before his death.

The exchange “was at the final stage” and would have taken place “with the mediation of the United Arab Emirates and Roman Abramovich,” Zhdanov said.

Claims about negotiations for a prisoner exchange, which were repeated on social media by other Navalny aides, could not be independently confirmed.

Shortly after the announcement of the funeral plans, Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, addressed European lawmakers in Strasbourg.

Speaking at the European Parliament, she confirmed that her husband would be buried on Friday and expressed fears that the police might interfere.

“I’m not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband,” she said.

At some points appearing tearful amid applause from lawmakers but largely resolute, Navalnaya said her husband’s death “showed everyone that Putin is capable of anything, and that you cannot negotiate with him.”

She appealed to the European Parliament to be “innovative” in its approach to the Russian president and those close to him.

“You cannot hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions,” she said, urging lawmakers instead to “apply the methods of fighting organized crime, not political competition.”

She asked the parliament to investigate “financial machinations” and “mafia associates” in their countries and “discreet lawyers and financiers who are helping Putin and his friends to hide money.”

In introducing Navalnaya, the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, paid tribute to Navalny.

“For many in Russia and outside, he represented hope. Hope in better days. Hope in a free Russia. Hope in the future,” she said.

Navalnaya and Navalny were married for more than 20 years, and she was at his side as he helped lead the biggest protests in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union.",Resume123,[],2024-02-28 09:46:04,"['navalny', 'russian', 'hope', 'funeral', 'parliament', 'zhdanov', 'russia', 'held', 'european', 'navalnys', 'alexei', 'putin']",ap_news_articles
Burundi detains dozens of soldiers who refused deployment in fight against M23 rebels in Congo,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Dozens of Burundian troops have been detained for refusing to be deployed to eastern Congo in the fight against the M23 rebel group as it advances toward a major border city, according to army officers, prison officials and other witnesses.

The dissenting soldiers were being held in at least four prisons across the tiny central African country, they told The Associated Press.

Clashes between M23, which the U.S. says is backed by Rwanda, and Congolese troops have intensified in recent weeks with the rebels threatening the Congo city of Goma on the Rwanda border.

Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye, in a public broadcast on Dec. 29, acknowledged the presence of Burundian troops in eastern Congo under the terms of a defense pact with Congolese authorities.

“If you do not help your neighbor put out the fire when his house is burning, tomorrow, if it is your turn, he will not come to help you,” he said. “If Burundi is going to help (Congo), it is defending itself.”

He said in that address that it was “normal for Burundian soldiers to be killed on Congolese territory.”

Tensions have been rising in Africa’s Great Lakes region as Rwanda, Burundi and Congo trade accusations over support for violent rebel groups operating in the lawless areas of eastern Congo.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has accused Rwanda’s government of actively supporting M23, which controls territory near the Rwanda border. U.N. experts have cited “solid evidence” that members of Rwanda’s armed forces were conducting operations in support of the rebels in eastern Congo. Rwanda denies supporting the M23.

At the same time, Burundi is accusing Rwanda of supporting another Congo-based rebel group opposed to Burundi’s government. The group, known as RED-Tabara, has claimed responsibility for multiple deadly attacks inside Burundi. The latest attack, in which at least nine people were killed, happened on Sunday.

Burundi last month suspended diplomatic relations with Rwanda and closed their border, calling it a response to Rwanda’s alleged backing of RED-Tabara, which is based in Congo’s South Kivu province. Rwanda denies the allegation.

Burundian authorities have not revealed how many troops have been deployed to eastern Congo. They also haven’t commented on the arrests of soldiers who refuse deployment across the border. Brig. Gaspard Baratuza, the Burundian military spokesman, did not respond to requests for comment.

According to two army officers and multiple prison guards who spoke to the AP, the arrests of dissenting soldiers started in December, with more than 200 detained. They include at least 103 in the Rumonge prison in the southwest, two prison guards there said. Others were being held in remand centers in Ngozi in the north, Ruyigi in the east, and Bururi in the south, according to prison guards in each of those penal institutions.

An army colonel in Bujumbura, the commercial capital, said many soldiers have been imprisoned “for having refused to fight alongside the (Congolese army) against the M23.” Some also face additional charges of stealing war funds, he said, without elaborating.

“Some have already been dismissed from the army, but there are also some who have been acquitted. It is no secret that many soldiers are detained for these acts,” he said.

The colonel, like others who spoke about the detentions, requested anonymity because of safety concerns.

A Burundian army captain told the AP he had deserted the military after refusing to be sent to Congo. “For a professional soldier to engage in combat, there must at least be the motive for the conflict,” he said. “He must also measure his strengths and weaknesses and those of the enemy. But in the current situation we are being asked to go and fight blindly.”

Washington has urged de-escalation of tensions in eastern Congo, where M23 is one of more than 100 armed groups active in eastern Congo, seeking a share of the region’s gold and other resources as they carry out mass killings.

Many M23 fighters, including Congolese Tutsis, were once members of Congo’s army. The group’s leaders say they are fighting to protect local Tutsis from extremist Hutu groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, whose members were among the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda.

Rwandan authorities cited concerns over this armed group in a statement last week rejecting U.S. calls for Rwanda to withdraw its troops and missile systems from Congolese territory.

Activists urge Nigeria to delay Shell’s sale of assets in polluted region over environmental worries,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Local activists and international environmental groups want Nigeria’s government to delay approving the sale of oil company Shell’s onshore assets, claiming Shell is trying to shirk its environmental and social responsibilities in the highly polluted Niger Delta.

The London-based company is trying to sell its subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company — which operates its onshore assets in the delta — to Renaissance Africa Energy Company, a consortium of local companies. Shell says the $2.4 billion divestment deal is part of a “wider reconfiguration of the Nigerian oil and gas sector.”

But the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), a Dutch non-profit, released a report Wednesday saying Shell shouldn’t be allowed to divest in the delta unless it takes “responsibility for its toxic legacy of pollution and ensures the safe decommissioning of abandoned oil infrastructure.”

Protesters have appealed to the government of Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, to halt the sale until environmental concerns are addressed. Lezina Mgbar, a 54-year-old healthcare worker and farmer who participated in a weekend demonstration in the country’s oil capital of Port Harcourt, said her Korokoro Tai community in Ogoniland has been “severely” affected by oil spills.

“In the morning, children and women have to travel far to get water, so children often cannot get to school on time, and our farm yields are poor,” Mgbar told The Associated Press. “We demand that Shell restore our land and clean our water before any divestment.”

Scientific studies have found high levels of chemical compounds from crude oil, as well as heavy metals, in the delta, where the industry largely drives Nigeria’s economy but can leave communities’ water sources slick with contaminants.

Activists say Shell has a history of poor divestment in the region. They point to a wellhead blowout in the Santa Barbara River, which flows through the Niger Delta, in 2021. The wellhead wasn’t producing but wasn’t decommissioned by Shell or its new owners, Aiteo Eastern E & P. The facility spewed crude oil and associated gas for 38 days and caused planet-warming methane to be released into the atmosphere, killed fish and devastated riverside farms.

Richard Steiner, an environmental consultant with a history of work in the Niger Delta, said the blowout on the Santa Barbara River highlights the risk of Shell and other oil majors transferring assets to new local firms without resolving legacy environmental and social concerns first.

“Many of the purchasing companies do not have the technical or financial capacity to manage these oil and gas operations safely,” he said.

Shell says it assesses the financial strength, culture and social and environmental performance records of companies it sells assets to. A spokesperson added that “mandatory submissions to the federal government allow the regulators to apply scrutiny across a wide range of issues and recommend approval of these divestments, provided they meet all requirements.”

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who holds the portfolio of petroleum minister, will ultimately decide the fate of the Shell-Renaissance transaction. His spokesperson did not comment when contacted on Monday.

SOMO’s report documents other cases of environmental pollution that were allegedly not addressed by Shell before past divestments. Two communities, Ogale and Bille in Rivers State, have been in court pushing to make the company address past environmental concerns.

Shell and other oil companies often blame third-party interference, namely militant attacks and vandalism by oil thieves, for spills. However, companies still must clean up regardless of the cause, according to Nigeria’s law.

The deal with Renaissance is the latest move by Shell to limit its onshore operations in Nigeria while focusing on deepwater operations. Other companies, including Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies, have been taking similar steps but without the scale of protests Shell, which is the most dominant in the region, has faced.

The civil society coalition that helped organize protests aimed at delaying the sale have petitioned Tinubu to adopt a set of principles to ensure more responsible petroleum industry divestments.

That “would help ensure a transparent process that would assess the capacity of the incoming companies, with meaningful community consultation throughout, address environmental pollution and deteriorating and abandoned infrastructure,” said Florence Kayemba, director of the Niger Delta-focused Stakeholder Democracy Network, one of the groups that came up with the principles.

Unlike in previous sales, Shell is transferring all its subsidiary shares to Renaissance, resulting in a change of ownership that would see SPDC continue to carry liabilities. Shell has said SPDC, with new ownership, will continue with the current staff and be responsible for remediation where spills have occurred in the past.

SOMO’s report noted the arrangement but said the energy giant is still trying to avoid its responsibility.

Audrey Gaughran, SOMO’s director, told the AP in a statement that “ensuring that the historical pollution, the lack of funding for safe decommissioning and poor financial transparency are fully addressed in Nigeria will be an important litmus test for a just energy transition across the world.”

Many in Iran are frustrated by unrest and poor economy. Parliament elections could see a low turnout,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran is holding parliamentary elections this Friday, yet the real question may not be who gets elected but how many people actually turn out to vote.

Widespread discontent over the cratering economy, years of mass protests rocking the country, and tensions with the West over Tehran’s nuclear program and Iran’s support for Russia in its war on Ukraine have many people quietly saying they won’t vote in this election.

Officials have urged people to cast ballots but tellingly, no information has been released this year from the state-owned polling center ISPA about expected turnout — a constant feature of past elections. Of 21 Iranians interviewed recently by The Associated Press, only five said they would vote. Thirteen said they won’t and three said they were undecided.

“If I protest about some shortcoming, many police and security agents will try to stop me,” said Amin, a 21-year-old university student who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals. “But if I die from hunger on the corner of one of the main streets, they will show no reaction.”

Over 15,000 candidates are vying for a seat in the 290-member parliament, formally known as the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Terms runs for four years and five seats are reserved for Iran’s religious minorities.

Under the law, the parliament has oversight over the executive branch, votes on treaties and handles other issues. In practice, absolute power in Iran rests with its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Hard-liners have controlled the parliament for the past two decades — with chants of “Death to America” often heard from the floor.

Under parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Revolutionary Guard general who supported a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999, the legislature pushed forward a bill in 2020 that greatly curtailed Tehran’s cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

That followed then-President Donald Trump’s unilateral withdrawal of America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 — an act that sparked years of tensions in the Middle East and saw Iran enrich enough uranium at record-breaking purity to have enough fuel for “several” nuclear weapons if it chose.

More recently, the parliament has focused on issues surrounding Iran’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, for women after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which sparked nationwide protests.

The protests quickly escalated into calls to overthrow Iran’s clerical rulers. A subsequent security crackdown killed over 500 people, with more than 22,000 detained.

Calls for an election boycott have spread in recent weeks, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a women’s right activist, who called them a “sham.”

“The Islamic Republic, with its ruthless and brutal suppression, the killing of young people on the streets, the executions and the imprisonment and torture of men and women, deserves national sanctions and global disgrace,” Mohammadi said in a statement.

The boycott calls have put the government under renewed pressure — since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran’s theocracy has based its legitimacy in part on turnout in elections.

On Wednesday, Khamenei himself urged people to vote, describing it as a national duty. “There is no reasoning behind not voting,” he said. “It does not solve any problem of the country.”

He also said “those who express a lack of interest in the election and encourage others not to participate should think some more.”

“If the election is weak, all face harm,” he added.

Though ISPA, the polling agency, conducted election surveys in October, its results have not been made public. Figures from politicians and other media outlets suggest a turnout of around 30%.

In the 2021 presidential election that brought hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi to power, the turnout was 49% — the lowest on record for a presidential vote. Millions of ballots were declared void, likely from those who felt obligated to vote but did not want to cast a ballot.

The 2019 parliament race saw a 42% turnout.

Separately, Iranians will also vote on Friday for members of the country’s 88-seat Assembly of Experts, an eight-year term on a panel that will appoint the country’s next supreme leader after Khamenei, 84.

Barred from that race is former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate under whose term Iran struck the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Some who spoke to the AP said Iran’s economic woes were the reason they are staying away from the polls. Inflation is reportedly at around 50%, with unemployment around 20% for young Iranians.

“I will not vote,” said Hashem Amani, a 55-year-old fruit merchant in southern Tehran. “In 2021, I voted for Raisi to become president in hope that similar people in the government can work together and make a better life for me. What I got in return was rocketing prices for everything.”

Morteza, a 53-year-old taxi driver who gave just his first name fearing reprisals, also expressed disenchantment.

“Why should I vote?” he asked. “I voted many times in the past yet I am paying for schooling of my three daughters. ... I am still a renter and continuously I keep moving to a poorer area.”

Others, like 42-year-old Marzieh Moqaddam, insisted they would vote. She compared voting to a religious duty and insisted the country needs “to improve the Islamic culture, like the hijab.”

However, Abbas Kazemi, a 32-year-old bank clerk, offered a far different reason why he is heading to the polls — protecting Iran’s legislature from the influence of the hard-liners that have controlled it for decades.

“We have to keep the election alive, otherwise hard-liners will shut it down forever,” he said.",Resume126,[],2024-02-28 05:23:35,"['elections', 'low', 'nuclear', 'economy', 'irans', 'parliament', 'past', 'unrest', 'frustrated', 'young', 'iran', 'poor', 'vote', 'islamic', 'election', 'turnout']",ap_news_articles
Two mayoral hopefuls of a Mexican city are shot dead within hours of each other,"MARAVATÍO, Mexico (AP) — Two mayoral hopefuls in the Mexican city of Maravatío have been gunned down within hours of each other, as experts warn the June 2 national elections could be the country’s most violent on record.

The widening control of drug cartels in Mexico has been described as a threat. During the last nationwide election in 2021, about three dozen candidates were killed.

The campaigns haven’t even started yet. They formally begin on Friday.

On Tuesday, this farming town, where most of the men wear boots and big belt buckles, was in a state of wary shock following the previous day’s killings. Dozens of state police were visible around city hall.

Talking about gynecologist Miguel Ángel Zavala, one of the murdered aspiring candidates, Maravatío resident and homemaker Carmen Luna said the crime was shocking and incomprehensible. “The way I see it, there’s no explanation for killing a person ... it might have been a power struggle between them.”

Luna was one of Zavala’s patients, and she ruled out any potential personal motive in his killing. “He was one of the best” doctors in town, she said. “He took care of me and was very good. He was very friendly.”

While she hasn’t voted in years — “whether it’s one or the other, everything stays the same” — Luna said the killings left people “angry and feeling powerless, because if the government doesn’t do anything, you can’t do anything.”

Maravatío Mayor Jaime Hinojosa Campa said he had not been told about threats against the mayoral hopefuls, but that “everything points toward” organized crime being behind the killings. He said authorities were working on security protocols for the remaining candidates who were understandably frightened.

“What happened yesterday scared all of us,” he said.

State prosecutors said Tuesday that Armando Pérez Luna was found shot to death in his car in Maravatío just before midnight. He was the mayoral candidate for the conservative National Action Party.

“This illustrates the extremely serious level of violence and lack of safety that prevails ahead of the most important elections in Mexican history,” National Action’s leader, Marko Cortés, wrote on social media.

Hours earlier, officials with the ruling Morena party confirmed their mayoral hopeful, Zavala, was found shot to death Monday in his car.

The Morena party state committee said in a statement that the killing of Zavala was “a cowardly and reprehensible act.” The head of the Morena party in Michoacan, Juan Pablo Celis, said Zavala had announced his intention to run but had not yet been designated as the party’s candidate.

Another Morena mayoral hopeful was killed last year.

Retiree Catalina Padilla was busy packing charity packages at the local Catholic Church’s food bank. She said the city had started getting violent around 2019.

“Before, we would go out at night, but now if there isn’t a reason to go out, you don’t,” Padilla said. She said Dagoberto García, the local Morena leader, was the other hopeful who initially disappeared last October until his shot and decomposed body was found in a rural area in November.

“It could be that they don’t want anyone from Morena,” she said, suggesting that killing Pérez, of the conservative PAN, was maybe a way to make it appear that the killings were not directed at one party.

The western state of Michoacan has been particularly hard hit by gang turf wars, with the Jalisco New Generation cartel fighting a local gang, the Viagras, for control.

The watchdog group Civic Data said in a January report on political violence that “2023 was the most violent year in our database. And everything suggests that 2024 will be worse.”

Mayoral, state and federal elections are increasingly synchronized on one election day. “It is likely that the biggest elections in history will also suffer the biggest attacks from organized crime,” Civic Data said.

Michoacan had the fifth-highest number of attacks on politicians and government officials in 2023, behind Guerrero state to the south and Guanajuato to the north. Zacatecas and Veracruz also had a higher number of attacks.

Civic Data said five people intending to run for office were killed in Mexico in January.

In a report published earlier this month, Integralia Consultants wrote that “organized crime will intervene like never before in local elections in 2024” because more mayor’s offices are at stake, more cartels are engaged in turf wars and cartels have expanded their business model far beyond drugs.

Cartels make much of their money extorting protection payments from local businesses and even local governments. That’s why mayoral races are more important to them than national elections and often become violent.

The violence has a chilling effect on democracy at the most local level.

Maravatío resident Marcos Bautista said Zavala and Pérez were political newcomers, respected local figures making their first foray into politics in a country tired of career politicians.

“They didn’t hold positions before, they were just starting out and they’re finishing them off,” Bautista said, noting that the only politicians left would be those willing to support the criminals. “Who is going to govern us?”

“I feel like voting isn’t going to solve anything,” said Miguel Ángel Negrete, another resident, adding that the killings “take away your rights ... make you afraid these people could come to the voting booths.”

Indonesia’s likely next president made 4-star general despite links to alleged human rights abuses,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday awarded an honorary four-star general rank to Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, a former high-ranking army officer who is linked to human rights abuses and who emerged as the apparent winner of the Feb. 14 presidential election.

Widodo gave the honorary promotion to Subianto, 72, in front of high-ranking military and police officials in Jakarta. A four-star general is Indonesia’s second-highest military rank, usually held by the officer who leads the country’s military.

“This award is a form of appreciation as well as confirmation of one’s complete devotion to the people, nation and state,” Widodo said on Wednesday.

Subianto’s vice presidential running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Widodo’s son.

Subianto, who is likely to become Indonesia’s next leader, was a lieutenant general and commander of the army special forces, known as Kopassus, that were blamed for human rights abuses including the torture of 22 activists who had opposed Suharto, the authoritarian leader whose 1998 downfall amid massive protests restored democracy in Indonesia.

Human rights groups have claimed that Subianto was also involved in a series of human rights violations in Timor-Leste in the 1980s and 90s, when Indonesia occupied the now-independent nation. Subianto has denied those allegations.

The alleged human rights abuses led to Subianto being forced out of the military and he was dishonorably discharged in 1998.

Subianto and other members of Kopassus were banned from traveling to the U.S. for years over the alleged human rights abuses they committed against the people of Timor-Leste. This ban lasted until 2020, when it was effectively lifted so he could visit the U.S. as Indonesia’s defense minister.

“Giving Subianto an honorary four-star title with his track record in the military, and allegations of involvement in cases of human rights violations, will embarrass the honor and dignity of the Indonesian military,” said Gufron Mabruri, the executive director of the Indonesian rights group Imparsial.

Subianto’s election win is not yet official. Unofficial tallies showed Subianto taking over 55% of the vote against his two rivals in a three-way race. Those counts, conducted by polling agencies and based on millions of ballots sampled from the across the country, have proved accurate in past elections.

If an official count confirms Subianto’s victory, he’ll take office in October.",Resume128,[],2024-02-28 05:43:01,"['rights', 'subianto', 'human', 'alleged', 'abuses', 'despite', 'indonesias', 'president', 'honorary', 'fourstar', 'links', 'military', 'likely', 'indonesian', 'general']",ap_news_articles
"Chatbots’ inaccurate, misleading responses about US elections threaten to keep voters from polls","NEW YORK (AP) — With presidential primaries underway across the U.S., popular chatbots are generating false and misleading information that threatens to disenfranchise voters, according to a report published Tuesday based on the findings of artificial intelligence experts and a bipartisan group of election officials.

Fifteen states and one territory will hold both Democratic and Republican presidential nominating contests next week on Super Tuesday, and millions of people already are turning to artificial intelligence -powered chatbots for basic information, including about how their voting process works.

Trained on troves of text pulled from the internet, chatbots such as GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini are ready with AI-generated answers, but prone to suggesting voters head to polling places that don’t exist or inventing illogical responses based on rehashed, dated information, the report found.

“The chatbots are not ready for primetime when it comes to giving important, nuanced information about elections,” said Seth Bluestein, a Republican city commissioner in Philadelphia, who along with other election officials and AI researchers took the chatbots for a test drive as part of a broader research project last month.

An AP journalist observed as the group convened at Columbia University tested how five large language models responded to a set of prompts about the election — such as where a voter could find their nearest polling place — then rated the responses they kicked out.

All five models they tested — OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama 2, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and Mixtral from the French company Mistral — failed to varying degrees when asked to respond to basic questions about the democratic process, according to the report, which synthesized the workshop’s findings.

Workshop participants rated more than half of the chatbots’ responses as inaccurate and categorized 40% of the responses as harmful, including perpetuating dated and inaccurate information that could limit voting rights, the report said.

For example, when participants asked the chatbots where to vote in the ZIP code 19121, a majority Black neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia, Google’s Gemini replied that wasn’t going to happen.

“There is no voting precinct in the United States with the code 19121,” Gemini responded.

Testers used a custom-built software tool to query the five popular chatbots by accessing their back-end APIs, and prompt them simultaneously with the same questions to measure their answers against one another.

While that’s not an exact representation of how people query chatbots using their own phones or computers, querying chatbots’ APIs is one way to evaluate the kind of answers they generate in the real world.

Researchers have developed similar approaches to benchmark how well chatbots can produce credible information in other applications that touch society, including in healthcare where researchers at Stanford University recently found large language models couldn’t reliably cite factual references to support the answers they generated to medical questions.

OpenAI, which last month outlined a plan to prevent its tools from being used to spread election misinformation, said in response that the company would “keep evolving our approach as we learn more about how our tools are used,” but offered no specifics.

Anthropic plans to roll out a new intervention in the coming weeks to provide accurate voting information because “our model is not trained frequently enough to provide real-time information about specific elections and ... large language models can sometimes ‘hallucinate’ incorrect information,” said Alex Sanderford, Anthropic’s Trust and Safety Lead.

Meta spokesman Daniel Roberts called the findings “meaningless” because they don’t exactly mirror the experience a person typically would have with a chatbot. Developers building tools that integrate Meta’s large language model into their technology using the API should read a guide that describes how to use the data responsibly to fine tune their models, he added. That guide does not include specifics about how to deal with election-related content.

“We’re continuing to improve the accuracy of the API service, and we and others in the industry have disclosed that these models may sometimes be inaccurate. We’re regularly shipping technical improvements and developer controls to address these issues,” Google’s head of product for responsible AI, Tulsee Doshi, said in response.

Mistral did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

In some responses, the bots appeared to pull from outdated or inaccurate sources, highlighting problems with the electoral system that election officials have spent years trying to combat and raising fresh concerns about generative AI’s capacity to amplify longstanding threats to democracy.

In Nevada, where same-day voter registration has been allowed since 2019, four of the five chatbots tested wrongly asserted that voters would be blocked from registering to vote weeks before Election Day.

“It scared me, more than anything, because the information provided was wrong,” said Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, a Democrat who participated in last month’s testing workshop.

The research and report are the product of the AI Democracy Projects, a collaboration between Proof News, a new nonprofit news outlet led by investigative journalist Julia Angwin, and the Science, Technology and Social Values Lab at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, led by Alondra Nelson, the former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Most adults in the U.S. fear that AI tools— which can micro-target political audiences, mass produce persuasive messages, and generate realistic fake images and videos — will increase the spread of false and misleading information during this year’s elections, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

And attempts at AI-generated election interference have already begun, such as when AI robocalls that mimicked U.S. President Joe Biden’s voice tried to discourage people from voting in New Hampshire’s primary election last month.

Politicians also have experimented with the technology, from using AI chatbots to communicate with voters to adding AI-generated images to ads.

Yet in the U.S., Congress has yet to pass laws regulating AI in politics, leaving the tech companies behind the chatbots to govern themselves.

Two weeks ago, major technology companies signed a largely symbolic pact to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to generate increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video, including material that provides “false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote.”

The report’s findings raise questions about how the chatbots’ makers are complying with their own pledges to promote information integrity this presidential election year.

Overall, the report found Gemini, Llama 2 and Mixtral had the highest rates of wrong answers, with the Google chatbot getting nearly two-thirds of all answers wrong.

One example: when asked if people could vote via text message in California, the Mixtral and Llama 2 models went off the rails.

“In California, you can vote via SMS (text messaging) using a service called Vote by Text,” Meta’s Llama 2 responded. “This service allows you to cast your vote using a secure and easy-to-use system that is accessible from any mobile device.”

To be clear, voting via text is not allowed, and the Vote to Text service does not exist.

A top EU official calls for a new defense industry strategy with locally made arms at its heart,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official called on Wednesday for a new defense industry strategy to respond to security challenges posed by Russia’s war on Ukraine with the purchase of weapons and ammunition made in Europe at its heart.

The Russian invasion has exposed glaring weaknesses in Europe’s arms manufacturing capacities. Reluctant to invest in staff and equipment without firm orders, the defense industry has been slow to ramp up production, most notably of the artillery shells that Ukraine so badly needs.

The creeping realization that former U.S. President Donald Trump might return to the White House and undermine support for Ukraine has also focused minds in Europe. EU heavyweights France and Germany have warned that the bloc must do more to protect itself.

“European sovereignty is about taking responsibility ourselves for what is vital, and even existential, for us,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “It is about our ability but also about our willingness to defend our interests and values ourselves.”

Laying out her vision of the new strategy to members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Von der Leyen said: “At the heart of this must be a simple principle: Europe must spend more, spend better, spend European.”

The war in Ukraine spurred European nations to hike defense spending, and a lot of money is destined for the U.S. defense industry. Germany, for example, announced a 100 billion-euro ($108 billion) upgrade of its armed forces, with a big chunk of the funds dedicated to U.S. F-35 fighter jets and transport helicopters.

Von der Leyen said the aim should be for countries to buy more, and more effectively, together just as the 27 EU nations did to purchase vaccines during the pandemic. To encourage industry to take more risks, she proposed that the EU should provide guarantees for advance weapons orders.

While production is improving, the EU had aimed to be making 1 million artillery shells annually by now but is only making around half that figure. Officials now say that production could reach 1.4 million shells per year by the end of December.

The head of the EU’s powerful executive branch also said that “it is time to start a conversation about using the windfall profits of frozen Russian assets to jointly purchase military equipment for Ukraine.”

Several billion euros in Russian assets are being held in Europe. Belgium estimates that it has around 180 billion euros ($195 billion) worth, and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has said that he wants to use all the interest on those funds for Ukraine’s reconstruction.

Von der Leyen, who is campaigning for a second term in office, also told the EU lawmakers that “I am personally supportive of a designated defense commissioner for the next commission,” without elaborating on what that portfolio might involve.

The EU has no army, and its member countries insist on sovereign control over their own armed forces.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell — who is also a vice-president of von der Leyen’s commission — said earlier this month that such a person could only really focus on Europe’s defense industry, saying: “Defense alone would be against the treaties” that the EU is based on.

Von der Leyen said the commission will make proposals for the new defense industry strategy in coming weeks.",Resume134,[],2024-02-28 09:52:34,"['strategy', 'defense', 'leyen', 'commission', 'calls', 'official', 'heart', 'ukraine', 'european', 'arms', 'der', 'locally', 'eu', 'industry', 'billion', 'europe']",ap_news_articles
EU watchdog wants new search and rescue rules after hundreds of migrants drown off Greece,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s administrative watchdog called Wednesday for a change to Europe’s search and rescue rules following an inquiry into last year’s sinking of a rusty fishing boat, the Adriana, carrying hundreds of migrants while traveling from Libya to Italy.

European Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly said current rules prevent the EU’s border and coast guard agency Frontex from fulfilling its obligations to protect the rights of migrants or act independently of national authorities when boats they use are in distress.

Up to 750 people were believed to be crammed aboard the Adriana when it sank off Greece last June. Just 104 people were rescued — mostly migrants from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt — and 82 bodies were found. Human rights groups accused Greek authorities of failing to properly investigate. Italian authorities were also involved in the incident.

“Why did reports of overcrowding, an apparent lack of life vests, children on board and possible fatalities fail to trigger timely rescue efforts that could have saved hundreds of lives?” O’Reilly asked.

Frontex provides surveillance and other support to the 27 national authorities — plus those of some EU partner countries — to help protect their maritime and land borders. In emergencies, it is obliged to follow the orders of those authorities and has no power to coordinate rescue missions.

O’Reilly said documents inspected during her inquiry showed that Frontex made four separate offers to assist Greek authorities with aerial surveillance of the Adriana but received no response. Current rules prevented Frontex from going to the ship without Greek permission.

“We must ask ourselves why a boat so obviously in need of help never received that help despite an EU agency, two member states’ authorities, civil society and private ships knowing of its existence,” O’Reilly said.

Thousands of people die or go missing in the Mediterranean each year in desperate attempts to reach Europe in barely seaworthy boats to escape poverty, war, abuse or discrimination. But the EU and member countries do not have a search and rescue mission actively patrolling.

The Italian authorities set up a search and rescue effort in 2013, but it was abandoned due to accusations that it only inspired more people to come. Italy and others have actively sought to stop charity ships from doing such work, sometimes by impounding their vessels.

“If Frontex has a duty to help save lives at sea, but the tools for it are lacking, then this is clearly a matter for EU legislators,” O’Reilly said. She said cooperation with national coastguards by Frontex when it lacks autonomy “risks making the EU complicit in actions that violate fundamental rights and cost lives.”

Reacting to the ombudsman’s findings, the agency said it “is deeply committed to saving lives and we’re always looking for ways to do our job better, especially when it comes to search and rescue missions.”

Frontex welcomed the ombudsman’s acknowledgement that the agency had followed all laws and procedures when alerting Greek and Italian authorities.

It said an assessment by Frontex’s own fundamental rights officer “confirms our adherence to international laws and the adequacy of our support to national authorities, alongside the proper conduct of search and rescue operations.”

EU member countries and lawmakers are currently negotiating a new overhaul of the bloc’s asylum and migration rules, and are trying to push it through before Europe-wide elections on June 6-9. The reforms do not include any proposals for proactive search and rescue missions.

Zelenskyy co-hosts a summit in Albania seeking more war support from southeastern Europe,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Ukraine’s president co-hosted a summit with Albania’s government on Wednesday that is meant to encourage further support for Kyiv by southeastern European countries, as signs of fatigue grow two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived before midnight Tuesday on the latest stop in an international tour that saw him in Saudi Arabia earlier Tuesday to push for a peace plan and the return of prisoners of war from Russia.

Zelenskyy on Wednesday called Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama “Ukraine’s unwavering friend” in a message on X, formerly Twitter, adding the two would “discuss defense and political cooperation, support for the Peace Formula, and security agreements.”

“I will propose supporting Ukraine’s efforts to achieve just and lasting peace, as well as organizing the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland,” he said, referring to the summit.

Zelenskyy and Rama also signed a friendship and cooperation agreement “to strengthen our cooperation with Albania and Ukraine’s position in the Balkans.” Zelenskyy also awarded Rama with the “Yaroslav the Wise” medal for his contribution to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy is accompanied by Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Rama wrote on Facebook that he was proud to welcome Zelenskyy for “a solidarity meeting and to further the commitment of our democracies against Russian aggression.”

Securing further support is key to Ukraine’s leader while his country faces battlefield challenges. Zelenskyy on Sunday announced that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since Russia’s invasion — the first time that Kyiv had confirmed the number of its losses.

Ukraine has urged Western leaders to increase the joint production of weapons and ammunition, improve Ukrainian air defenses and put new pressure on Russia via expanded sanctions. The head of NATO has said the U.S.-led military alliance has no plans to send troops to Ukraine, and Germany, Poland and other countries this week have said the same.

Eleven countries from southeastern Europe, including some of Ukraine’s neighbors, attended the Albania summit, three of them with online messages, along with officials from the European Union and other international institutions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Albania earlier this month.

But not all the countries are in full support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Kremlin ally Serbia is the only European country that has refused to align with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion. It continues signing cooperation agreements with Moscow.

Albania, a NATO member since 2009 and a candidate for EU membership, has voiced its full support for Kyiv against Russia’s invasion. It has provided military assistance in the form of ammunition and training of Ukrainian military. It was among the first countries offering shelter to Ukrainian refugees. It has joined international sanctions against Russian officials and institutions.

As a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in the last two years, Albania joined the U.S. in initiating resolutions against Russia’s invasion.

Moldovan breakaway region appeals to Russia as a spat with the pro-Western government worsens,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Officials in Moldova’s Russia-backed breakaway region of Transnistria appealed to Moscow for protection Wednesday, as tensions escalate with the pro-Western government.

Moldova, a candidate to join the European Union, imposed new customs duties on Jan. 1, 2024 on imports to and exports from Transnistria, which borders Ukraine and is not recognized by any United Nations member countries, including Russia which maintains close ties to the region.

On Wednesday, members of the Transnistrian congress used a rare meeting in the regional capital, Tiraspol, to ask the Russian Duma to “implement measures for defending Transnistria amid increasing pressure from Moldova, given the fact that more than 220,000 Russian citizens reside in Transnistria.”

A short war in the early 1990s led pro-Russian forces in Transnistria to declare a breakaway state. To this day, Russia stations about 1,500 troops in the region as so-called peacekeepers, who guard huge Soviet-era weapons and ammunition stockpiles.

Moldova is working to align its economic legislation with the EU as it pursues full membership in the bloc. But the new customs duties leveled on Transnistria have angered officials there, who say the measures harm local residents and businesses.

In a declaration readout on Wednesday, officials in Tiraspol also appealed to the European Parliament to prevent what it described as pressure from Moldova from “violating the rights and freedoms” of local residents. They made similar appeals to the secretary-general of the United Nations; the European Parliament; and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting, tensions mounted after an opposition legislator in Tiraspol last week said the gathering could used to announce a bid by Transnistria to join Russia.

A spokesperson for Moldova’s government dismissed those claims and labeled the meeting a “propaganda event,” adding that there was “no danger of escalation.”

Alexander Korshunov, chairman of the Transnistrian Supreme Council, said on Wednesday that Moldova was “taking advantage of the geopolitical situation” and using the economy “as a tool of pressure and blackmail.”

He added: “Moldova’s policy and goals regarding Transnistria have remained unchanged over the past decades: to destroy our economic potential, create unbearable living conditions for our citizens … and achieve the dismantling of our statehood.”

Maria Zakharova, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, also commented on those annexation speculations on Wednesday. “For several days now, people in Chisinau have been speculating and wondering what decisions this forum might make,” she said. “Well, apparently, the same panic gripped NATO.”

In a 2006 referendum in Moldova, more than 95% of voters backed the option of joining Russia but the ballot wasn’t internationally recognized. The U.S. State Department at the time called it a “provocative referendum” that “cannot be taken seriously.”

Moldova was granted EU candidate status in 2022. It was further buoyed in December last year when Brussels said it would open accession negotiations, alongside neighboring Ukraine.

Transnistria, which has a population of about 470,000, is a thin strip of territory located between the eastern bank of the Dniester River and Moldova’s border with Ukraine. The unrecognized state, officially named the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, has its own currency and flag.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Moldova’s pro-Western leaders have routinely accused Moscow of conducting campaigns to try to destabilize the country, which was a Soviet republic until 1991.

Hong Kong’s plan for a new national security law deepens fears over eroding civil liberties,"HONG KONG (AP) — As Hong Kong moves toward enacting a new national security law, four years after Beijing imposed a similar law that all but wiped out dissent and vocal pro-democracy media in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, concerns are spreading among the city’s international business and media communities.

Critics say the legislation will make Hong Kong’s legal system increasingly similar to that of mainland China, but the government argues it will affect only a “small minority” of disloyal residents.

Businesses and journalists fear that broad provisions on state secrets could criminalize their day to day work.

The Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, requires it to pass a home-grown national security law. But previous efforts to pass such a law were defeated by a massive protest that saw them as efforts to erode the civil liberties Beijing promised to keep intact in the former British colony for 50 years after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

However, following a year of massive pro-democracy protest that rocked the city in 2019, China’s rulers took harsh measures to impose control.

Under Beijing’s 2020 National Security Law, many of the city’s leading activists were arrested and others fled abroad. Several vocal media outlets were shuttered. Large protests have been absent in the city in the post-pandemic era.

That law targeted politically active Hongkongers, but businesses and journalists are worried that the local law could bring more mainland-style surveillance and censorship to Hong Kong.

The city’s many companies are concerned about how the new law could affect handling economic data or exclusive research, said George Chen, Hong Kong-based managing director for American policy consulting firm The Asia Group.

A public consultation document proposed criminal prosecution for unlawfully disclosing state secrets, echoing the broad definition of secrets used in mainland China, which covers economic, social and technological developments among other areas.

Last year, Chinese authorities raided the offices of consulting firm Capvision and corporate due diligence firm Mintz Group in mainland China as part of an ongoing crackdown on foreign businesses that handle sensitive economic data. An employee of a Japanese drug maker was also detained on spying charges.

In response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said in an email that the legislation targets “an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security,” insisting that normal business people, individuals, organizations and the media sector “will not unwittingly violate the law.”

It added that countries including Britain, the U.S. and Canada also have state secrets laws that cover sensitive information beyond traditional security fields, provided its unauthorized disclosure could jeopardize national security.

It’s not clear when the government will table a bill in the legislature. A one-month public comment period ends Wednesday, and the government has said it intends to pass the law this year. With the legislature packed with Beijing loyalists following an electoral overhaul, it’s expected to pass easily.

Johannes Hack, the president of the German Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told The Associated Press that the new law could change how people see the city’s status in China. For decades, Beijing allowed the city to maintain rule of law and civil liberties under a policy called “one country, two systems.”

The new definition of state secrets, he said in an email, “may increase the perception that the ‘one country’ aspect of Hong Kong’s special status is more in focus than the “two systems.’”

“For Hong Kong to present a distinctive business advantage vis-a-vis the mainland, the two systems part is however quite important. Hong Kong in our view should be different ‘in fact and feeling,’” Hack said. The costs for businesses to comply with the “quite broad definition” of state secrets may also lead to investment being channeled elsewhere, he added.

The European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said it will study the consultation with great interest, while the American Chamber of Commerce said it was still soliciting members’ views.

Journalists, too, fear the implications of the new law.

A leading group for media professionals, Hong Kong Journalists Association, said in a submission to the government that all members who took part in a survey this month felt the new law would negatively affect press freedom, with 90% saying the effect would be significant.

The association said the broad and vague definition of state secrets would make it challenging for journalists to make sound judgement on what could constitute a threat to national security, and that could deter the press from reporting.

The group also expressed concern over a proposal to treat “colluding with foreign forces to issue a ‘misleading’ statement” that could endanger national security either intentionally or through negligence, as espionage. It feared that foreign public media services, such as the BBC or Voice of America, and their employees could be classified as “external forces.”

Two local news outlets known for critical coverage of the government, Apple Daily and Stand News, were already forced to shut down following the 2020 law, and senior management including Apple Daily publisher Jimmy Lai have been prosecuted.

Over the past month, the government briefed diplomats, business leaders and professional groups in a bid to allay their concerns. The officials often referred to the chaotic 2019 street protests to need for the new law.

Hong Kong leader John Lee previously said that the majority of the opinions submitted during the consultation period were in support of the new law.

It’s hard to know how the ordinary people feel about the law in the city’s present political climate. Any major protest is virtually impossible under the chilling effect after the existing security law was introduced. Many discussions about the proposals involving various sectors and residents were held privately. A pro-democracy party staged a small-scale protest against the law under police watch on Tuesday.

Secretary for Security Chris Tang has staunchly defended the proposed legislation, rejecting claims that parts of the law target media.

Michael Davis, professor of law and international affairs at O. P. Jindal Global University in India, said that ambiguities in the law’s text could spread fear beyond what’s explicitly banned. When laws are vague, he said, the public may not know what is prohibited until someone is prosecuted.

The consultation document signaled that the Hong Kong government intends to adopt almost completely the far-reaching national security concepts used in mainland China, he said.

Officials have pledged to add more precise definitions of the elements and penalties of the offences to the final bill, and said they would consider adding a public interest defense.",Resume138,"['Leung Covers Hong Kong', 'Macao', 'Mainland China For The Associated Press.

South Korean and US troops will begin major exercises next week in response to North Korean threats,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean and U.S. troops will begin their expanded annual military drills next week in response to North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats, the two countries said Wednesday, a move that will likely enrage North Korea because it views its rivals’ joint training as an invasion rehearsal.

In recent months, North Korea has inflamed animosities on the Korean Peninsula with fiery rhetoric and continued missile tests. While it’s unlikely for North Korea to launch full-blown attacks against South Korea and the U.S., observers say the North could still stage limited provocations along the tense border with South Korea.

On Wednesday, the South Korea and U.S. militaries jointly announced that the allies will conduct Freedom Shield exercise, a computer-simulated command post training, and a variety of separate field training, from March 4-14.

Col. Lee Sung-Jun, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the allies’ drills are designed to bolster their joint capabilities to prevent North Korea from using its nuclear weapons. He said the allies are to carry out 48 field exercises this spring, twice the number conducted last year, and that this year’s drills would involve air assault, live-firing and bombing training.

“Our military is ready to punish North Korea immediately, strongly and to the end in the event of its provocation, and we’ll further strengthen our firm readiness through the upcoming drills,” Lee said.

Col. Isaac L. Taylor, a spokesperson for the U.S. military, said the allies’ exercises have been defensive in nature and that there is solid evidence that “a high readiness rate” helps ensure deterrence.

North Korea didn’t immediately respond to the drills’ announcement. North Korea has reacted to previous major South Korea-U.S. military drills with its own missile tests.

North Korea has sharply intensified its weapons testing activities since 2022 in part of its efforts to expand its nuclear and missile arsenals. This year, the North already conducted six rounds of missile tests — five of them reportedly involving cruise missiles — and other weapons launches.

Lee, the South Korean military spokesperson, said that the upcoming South Korea-U.S. drills would involve training to detect and shoot down North Korean cruise missiles. Analysts say North Korea would likely use cruise missiles to attack incoming U.S. warships in the event of a conflict, as well as U.S. military installations in Japan. The North’s weapons tests in 2022 and 2023 largely focused on ballistic weapons systems.

Experts say North Korea believes a bigger weapons arsenal would allow it to pressure the U.S. and South Korea more effectively to make concessions like sanctions relief when diplomacy resumes. They expect North Korea to ramp up its testing activities and other provocations this year as both the U.S. and South Korea head into major elections.

South Korea and the U.S. have responded to the North’s testing spree with expansions of their bilateral military drills and trilateral exercises involving Japan. U.S. and South Korean officials have repeatedly warned that any nuclear attack by North Korea against them would spell the end of the North’s government led by Kim Jong Un.

In a telephone call earlier Wednesday, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin condemned North Korea’s missile tests and reaffirmed the need to maintain an overwhelming joint defense posture, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The Pentagon said Austin reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the defense of South Korea.

A small drone flies into a damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor for the first time to study melted fuel,"TOKYO (AP) — A drone small enough to fit in one’s hand flew inside one of the damaged reactors at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Wednesday in hopes it can examine some of the molten fuel debris in areas where earlier robots failed to reach.

Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings also began releasing the fourth batch of the plant’s treated and diluted radioactive wastewater into the sea Wednesday. The government and TEPCO, the plant’s operator, say the water is safe and the process is being monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but the discharges have faced strong opposition by fishing groups and a Chinese ban on Japanese seafood.

A magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in March 2011 destroyed the plant’s power supply and cooling systems, causing three reactors to melt down. The government and TEPCO plan to remove the massive amount of fatally radioactive melted nuclear fuel that remains inside each reactor — a daunting decommissioning process that’s been delayed for years and mired by technical hurdles and a lack of data.

To help on data, a fleet of four drones were set to fly one at a time into the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor’s primary containment vessel. TEPCO plans to probe a new area Thursday.

TEPCO has sent a number of probes — including a crawling robot and an underwater vehicle — inside each reactor but was hindered by debris, high radiation and the inability to navigate through the rubble, though they were able to gather some data. In 2015, the first robot to go inside got stuck on a grate.

Wednesday’s drone flight comes after months of preparations that began in July at a nearby mock facility.

The drones, each weighing 185 grams (6.5 ounces), are highly maneuverable and their blades hardly stir up dust, making them a popular model for factory safety checks. Each carries a front-loaded high-definition camera to send live video and higher-quality images to an operating room.

In part due to battery life, the drone investigation inside a reactor is limited to a 5-minute flight.

TEPCO officials said they plan to use the new data to develop technology for future probes as well as a process to remove the melted fuel from the reactor. The data will also be used in the investigation of how the 2011 meltdown occurred.

On Wednesday, two drones inspected the area around the exterior of the main structural support in the vessel, called the pedestal. Based on the images they transmitted, TEPCO officials decided to send the other two in Thursday.

The pedestal is directly under the reactor’s core. Officials hope to film the core’s bottom to find out how overheated fuel dripped there in 2011.

About 880 tons of highly radioactive melted nuclear fuel remain inside the three damaged reactors. Critics say the 30- to 40-year cleanup target set by the government and TEPCO is overly optimistic. The damage in each reactor is different, and plans need to accommodate their conditions.

TEPCO’s goal is to remove a small amount of melted debris from the least-damaged No. 2 reactor as a test case by the end of March by using a giant robotic arm. It was forced to delay due to difficulty removing a deposit blocking its entry.

As in the past three rounds of wastewater discharges which started in August, TEPCO plans to release 7,800 metric tons of the treated water through mid-March after diluting it with massive amounts of seawater and sampling it to make sure radioactivity is far below international standards.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday accused Japan of risking the whole world with “nuclear-contaminated water” and demanded it stop “this wrongdoing.” Mao urged Japan to cooperate in an independent monitoring system with neighboring countries and other stakeholders.",Resume140,[],2024-02-28 05:10:09,"['study', 'fukushima', 'nuclear', 'remove', 'melted', 'water', 'radioactive', 'inside', 'data', 'damaged', 'reactor', 'small', 'drone', 'flies', 'fuel', 'tepco', 'reactors']",ap_news_articles
Biden acts to better protect Americans’ personal data such as health records and finances,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday is signing an executive order aimed at better protecting Americans’ personal data on everything from biometrics and health records to finances and geolocation from foreign adversaries like China and Russia.

The attorney general and other federal agencies are to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans’ personal data to what the White House calls “countries of concern,” while erecting safeguards around other activities that can give those countries access to people’s sensitive data.

The goal is to do so without limiting legitimate commerce around data, senior Biden administration officials said on a call with reporters.

Biden’s move targets commercial data brokers, the sometimes shadowy companies that traffic in personal data and that officials say may sell information to foreign adversaries or U.S. entities controlled by those countries.

Most eventual enforcement mechanisms still have to clear complicated and often monthslong rulemaking processes. Still, the administration hopes eventually to limit foreign entities, as well as foreign-controlled companies operating in the U.S., that might otherwise improperly collect sensitive data, the senior officials said.

Data brokers are legal in the U.S. and collect and categorize personal information, usually to build profiles on millions of Americans that the brokers then rent or sell.

The officials said activities like computer hacking are already prohibited in the U.S., but that buying potentially sensitive data through brokers is legal. That can represent a key gap in the nation’s national security protections when data is sold to a broker knowing it could end up in the hands of an adversary — one the administration now aims to close with the president’s executive action.

“Bad actors can use this data to track Americans, including military service members, pry into their personal lives, and pass that data on to other data brokers and foreign intelligence services,” the White House wrote in a fact sheet announcing the move. “This data can enable intrusive surveillance, scams, blackmail, and other violations of privacy.”

The order directs the Department of Justice to issue regulations that establish protections for Americans’ sensitive personal data, as well as sensitive government-related data — including geolocation information on sensitive government sites and members of the military.

The Justice Department also plans to work with Homeland Security officials to build safety standards to prevent foreign adversaries from collecting data. It will further attempt better checks to ensure that federal grants going to various other agencies, including the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, aren’t used to facilitate Americans’ sensitive data flowing to foreign adversaries or U.S. companies aligned with them.

The senior administration officials listed potential countries of concern as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. But it is China — and TikTok, which has over 150 million American users and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. — that U.S. leaders have been most vocal about.

Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, recently noted, “There’s no such thing as a private business in China.”

The senior administration officials stressed that the executive action was designed to work in conjunction with legislative action. So far, however, numerous bills seeking to establish federal privacy protections have failed to advance in Congress.

Albert Fox Cahn, a Harvard fellow and executive director of the nonprofit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said Wednesday’s order doesn’t address the core issue of Americans’ exposure to rampant data collection by industry and government -- and the absence of a federal privacy law.

“For most Americans, the country of greatest concern on surveillance is the U.S. Americans are tracked every day by an increasingly invasive array of private data brokers and government agencies, transforming nearly every aspect of our digital lives into a marketing and policing tools,” he said.

“This executive order will do almost nothing to address the real privacy needs that most Americans have, and continues to conflate surveillance capitalism with foreign surveillance. Only in Washington, does privacy once again get misunderstood as a foreign threat, rather than a domestic industry,” he added. “None of this is a substitute for the civil rights and privacy protections the public so desperately needs.”

Wednesday’s move follows Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence last fall that seeks to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights.

That sought to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy, creating early guardrails meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive.",Resume141,"['Will Is A National Political Reporter Based In Washington.', 'Technology Writer Covering Social Media', 'The Internet']",2024-02-28 10:02:08,"['executive', 'americans', 'finances', 'surveillance', 'acts', 'protect', 'better', 'data', 'health', 'biden', 'officials', 'sensitive', 'foreign', 'brokers', 'personal', 'records', 'privacy']",ap_news_articles
Can conservative Latin American populists motivate the Hispanic vote? Republicans are counting on it,"OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — On a recent evening outside Washington, the president of Argentina had the eyes and ears of a conservative crowd that had gathered to listen to Donald Trump. In a raspy voice, Javier Milei called out, “Hola a todos,” or “Hello, everyone,” before introducing himself as a lion.

“What a beautiful day to make the left tremble,” Milei joked.

His eccentrics may have seemed novel to those in the crowd unfamiliar with how he has used lions as his brand to symbolize his fierce stance against socialism, but the far-right populist has become well-known among Latinos in the United States since winning the presidency last year. He was joined at the Conservative Political Action Conference by El Salvador’s millennial president, Nayib Bukele, who delighted the crowd with a speech in fluent English deriding philanthropist George Soros and “globalism.”

The Republican Party is aligning with some Latin American populists as a way of injecting star power and the political landscape of immigrants’ home countries into this year’s U.S. election. Having made inroads with Cuban and Venezuelan Americans in South Florida by attacking the self-declared socialist leaders of those countries, GOP leaders are replicating that model by promoting ties between Trump and leaders who are well known by Spanish-speaking voters across the country.

Mercedes Schlapp, a former Trump White House aide, told Spanish-language newscasters that Democrats have been nurturing the Latino vote for a long time, but when Trump was seeking reelection in 2020, he told his strategists to “do whatever you can to get the Latino vote.” Schlapp said that pursuing the popular elected leaders to join the recent conservative gathering is part of that effort.

At nearly 2.5 million people, Salvadorans outnumber Cubans in the U.S., according to the Pew Hispanic Research Center. The Argentine diaspora is much smaller. But both Bukele and Milei have grabbed the attention of immigrants from Latin America as populist counterweights to the leftist strongmen scattered across Central and South America.

Jose Aliaga, a Peruvian immigrant who attended CPAC as a Republican leader of a township in Michigan, compared Bukele after his speech to Trump, who is closing in on his third GOP nomination and a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.

“Not only does Bukele say all the right things, he has results to show,” Aliaga said. “Bukele and Trump have the same message. They want to stop crime, they want to improve the economy, offer more jobs and give everyone the opportunity to get ahead.

“They both want to rule with an iron fist, but one speaks Spanish and the other speaks English,” he said.

Milei campaigned with a chainsaw as his prop to campaign on drastic cuts in Argentina and has declared his admiration for Trump. Milei didn’t bring the chainsaw to CPAC, but when he saw Trump between their speeches, Milei rushed to Trump screaming “president!” and gave him a close hug before they posed for pictures. According to a video posted by one of his aides, Trump told him, “Make Argentina Great Again,” referencing Milei’s Trump-inspired campaign slogan.

The day before his visit, Milei met in Buenos Aires with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other Biden administration officials. According to one of Milei’s ministers, U.S. Ambassador Marc Stanley, a Texas lawyer and Democratic donor, tried to dissuade Milei from appearing alongside Trump, saying CPAC was a “very political” event.

The State Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires said, “We make no comments on private meetings.”

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban American who has endorsed Trump, traveled to Argentina’s Casa Rosada last week to meet Milei and asked him to autograph a mug with the slogan “No hay plata,” for “There is no money,” which Milei used in campaign to say the country will no longer subsidize public programs.

Eduardo Verástegui is a conservative activist who rose to fame in the 1990s as a Mexican telenovela heartthrob and tried to run independently for Mexico’s presidency. He describes Trump as a friend and was invited in 2020 to advise him on Hispanic issues.

“Having them here on an election year is unique. It can awaken the Hispanic community in the U.S.,” Verástegui said. “I think this could be a turning point.”

Maca Casado, a spokeswoman for Biden’s campaign, criticized Trump’s plan to appeal to Latinos, saying his policies as president and proposals as candidates are anti-immigrant.

“We are talking about a man who has consistently demonized Latinos for his political gain, who used his time in office to attack the Latino community, who has even parroted dictators and said immigrants were poisoning the blood of the country,” Casado said in a statement. “Our community knows the truth: The party of Trump doesn’t give a damn about Latinos.”

Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that these leaders are “either intentionally antagonizing the White House or making an easily avoidable diplomatic misstep.”

Bukele was perhaps even more popular at CPAC, followed by dozens of supporters after his speech Thursday who were blowing horns and shouting his name.

A Spanish-language journalist from Voz Media, a conservative outlet based in Texas, approached Bukele to ask questions about Biden and Trump. Bukele said the Biden administration “has not been interested in working with us.” He said the relations between the two countries under Trump were “much better,” but he stopped short of throwing his support for Trump. “I leave that to the people.”

Bukele has become massively popular in El Salvador, as a result of his war on gangs that has led to 76,000 detentions, and among Salvadorans in the U.S., who can be found in large numbers in California, Texas and New York.

Bukele made a point in his speech to call out the Clinton administration for deporting members of a gang that was formed in the U.S. by Salvadorans who had immigrated escaping the 1979-1992 civil war. That gang was MS-13, which is often misunderstood as having been founded in El Salvador.

A Bukele adviser said the leader wanted to come to speak to conservatives to promote his efforts to turn around El Salvador. Homicide rates have fallen sharply and the country went from being one of the most violent to one of the safest in the Americas.

In a hotel right across the venue where conservatives met, two hotel maids knew exactly the time Bukele was set to appear and were hoping to catch a glimpse of the leader, saying their native El Salvador had changed.

When asked if they were equally excited to see Trump, they smiled and shook their heads.

"Oil spill from capsized barge near Tobago has reached beaches hundreds of miles away, officials say","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — An offshore oil spill that prompted Trinidad and Tobago to declare a national emergency earlier this month has reached the shores of the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire hundreds of miles away, authorities said. This is the first sign of how far the leaked oil has traveled.

Government officials said the oil poses a “serious threat” to the island and its nature including its mangroves, fish and corals. The oil washed up in areas along Bonaire’s east coast despite efforts to contain it, the government statement said Monday.

Bonaire is more than 500 miles (830 kilometers) east of Tobago, where the spill occurred.

Officials have said they don’t how much oil has leaked or remains on board.

The oil is leaking from an overturned barge that had departed from Panama and was being tugged to nearby Guyana when it began to sink, according to a preliminary investigation. The owner of the barge has not been identified.

Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of Energy said Tuesday that crews completed an investigative hydrographic survey of the wreck to allow officials to create a map of the seabed and other data around the wreck, which foreign experts are helping to remove.

A warlord involved in hundreds of murders is repatriated to Colombia after serving a US drug sentence,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian warlord Salvatore Mancuso was repatriated Tuesday after serving a drug trafficking sentence in the United States and being denied several requests to be sent to Italy, where he also has citizenship.

Mancuso arrived in Bogota’s El Dorado Airport on a charter flight that also carried dozens of Colombians who were deported from the U.S. after illegally crossing the southern border. Mancuso was quickly taken into police custody, wearing a green helmet and a bulletproof vest.

Human rights organizations and government officials in Colombia hope that Mancuso will cooperate with the justice system and provide information about hundreds of crimes that took place when paramilitary groups fought leftist rebels in rural Colombia in the 1990s and early 2000s.

“This event marks an important step towards reconciliation and the construction of a lasting peace in Colombia,” said Fernando García, the director of Colombia’s national immigration service.

Mancuso, 59, was one of the leaders of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia, a paramilitary group founded by cattle ranchers who fought against leftist rebels during one of the most violent stretches of Colombia’s decades-long armed conflict.

He will remain in prison in Colombia, where courts have judged him responsible for more than 1,500 acts of murder and disappearances. He will attempt to get a reduced sentence, and possibly a release from prison, from a transitional justice system created by Colombia’s 2016 peace deal.

Victims of the nation’s conflict are hoping that Mancuso helps shed light on hundreds of murders and forced disappearances carried out by paramilitary fighters, including extrajudicial executions where victims were buried in mass graves.

In multiple hearings with Colombian judges, including some by teleconference while in U.S. custody, the former warlord has spoken of his dealings with politicians, and of the potential involvement of high-ranking politicians in war crimes.

But his extradition to the United States in 2008 had slowed investigations.

“When Mancuso was extradited, truth was extradited, as well as justice and reparations for victims,” said José Melendez, a human rights lawyer who represents war victims in northern Colombia.

“We welcome him. And want him to tell the truth about the multinational companies, the businessmen and the government ministers who helped with the creation of paramilitary groups.”

Mancuso was born to a wealthy family in the department of Cordoba in northwest Colombia, and was a prosperous cattle rancher.

He began to collaborate with the Colombian army in the early ‘90s after his family was threatened by rebel groups who demanded extortion payments.

Mancuso quickly transitioned from providing intel to the military to leading operations against leftist rebels, and by the late ‘90s he had become one of the most powerful paramilitary leaders in Colombia.

In 2003, he joined a peace process under which paramilitary leaders demobilized in exchange for reduced sentences.

But he was extradited to the United States five years later during the administration of President Álvaro Uribe, along with 13 other paramilitary leaders who were wanted for drug trafficking in the United States.

Critics said that the surprise extradition was part of an effort to stop Mancuso and other paramilitary leaders from discussing their ties with Colombia’s political establishment.

Mancuso was sentenced in 2015 for guiding more than 130 tons of cocaine to U.S. soil, as he turned to drug trafficking to finance his armed group.

He completed his 12-year-sentence in 2020, and had been held at an immigration detention center for three years, as officials decided where to send him.

Mancuso is the son of an Italian immigrant. His lawyers had requested he be deported to Italy, where he is a citizen, arguing his life would be in danger in Colombia.

U.S. officials decided instead to send Mancuso to Colombia, whose government requested his extradition in 2020, arguing that his return to the country was vital for the investigation of war crimes.

“The problem Mancuso has is that if he talks too much and he could get killed,” said Laura Bonilla, a researcher of Colombia’s conflict for the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation.

The administration of President Gustavo Petro already has given Mancuso, prior to his arrival, a special designation to play a role in peace negotiations despite being in prison.

The government is currently engaged in peace talks with two left-wing rebel groups who were not part of a 2016 peace deal. It has also tried unsuccessfully to start peace talks with the AGC, a right-wing group that was set up following the disarmament of Mancuso’s paramilitary group.

Jair Bolsonaro is under investigation in Brazil for allegedly harassing a whale off Sao Paulo,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is under investigation for having allegedly “harassed” a humpback whale while riding a personal watercraft off Sao Paulo’s coast last year.

Bolsonaro appeared at the federal police in Sao Paulo on Tuesday to meet with officers, along with his lawyer and former adviser who was also present at the time of the alleged incident.

The investigation is just one of the many legal headaches the former far-right leader is facing. Since leaving office a year ago, Bolsonaro has been banned from running for office until 2030, investigated for plotting a coup to remove his successor from power and stripped of his passport.

In a June 2023 video that circulated on social media, a man is seen riding a personal watercraft close to a whale, seemingly recording the encounter with a cellphone. Federal prosecutors, who are also investigating the case, said the man appeared to be Bolsonaro.

Under Brazilian legislation, motored vessels must keep a minimum distance of 100 meters from whales and other cetaceans. Any intentional attempt to get closer can lead to a sentence of up to two to five years in prison and a fine.

The man on the personal watercraft seemed to be about 15 meters from the animal, prosecutors said last year.

For Bolsonaro’s large base, the case is yet another example that their former leader is being politically persecuted — an argument he has often made since leaving office.

Last week, officers in the capital, Brasilia, questioned Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting a coup, in an attempt to remove his successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from power. Bolsonaro, whose passport was seized in a previous police operation, chose to remain silent.

Supreme Court documents show that investigators believe that Bolsonaro and some of his aides, including former ministers and top military advisers, prepared a decree that would have declared the 2022 election vote fraudulent, had Bolsonaro lost the election to his leftist opponent, Lula.

The decree also planned for the arrest of a Supreme Court justice and the convening of a new election. Bolsonaro lost, but the decree was never issued, and the alleged plan was never set into action.

Bolsonaro was also ruled ineligible to run for office until 2030 by a panel of judges, who concluded that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country’s electronic voting system.

Last year, Bolsonaro, his wife and close aides had to face investigators’ questions in yet another case, after an attempt to sneak in diamond jewelry reportedly worth $3 million and the sale of two luxury watches Bolsonaro received as gifts from Saudi Arabia while in office.

Police are also investigating the nation’s intelligence agency and alleged spying on Bolsonaro’s political opponents during his term, which ended in December 2022.

Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing.

Legal experts say that if police can prove that Bolsonaro intentionally approached the whale, he risked a fine at most. According to online news site G1, a local politician found guilty on similar charges and in the same location was fined 2,500 reais (just over $500).",Resume145,[],2024-02-27 20:05:10,"['bolsonaro', 'watercraft', 'office', 'allegedly', 'decree', 'paulo', 'jair', 'man', 'investigation', 'power', 'sao', 'brazil', 'election', 'case', 'harassing', 'personal', 'whale']",ap_news_articles
Rocket fire reported off Yemen in Red Sea in a new suspected attack by Houthi rebels,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A rocket exploded late Tuesday night off the side of a ship traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, authorities said, the latest suspected attack to be carried out by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The attack comes as the Houthis continue a series of assaults at sea over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as the U.S. and its allies launch airstrikes trying to stop them.

The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which oversees shipping in the Mideast, reported the attack happened about 110 kilometers (70 miles) off the coast of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida. The rocket exploded several miles off the bow of the vessel, it said.

“The crew and vessel are reported to be safe and are proceeding to next port of call,” the UKMTO said.

The private security firm Ambrey reported that the vessel targeted appeared to be a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier in the area at the time. Another ship, a Panama-flagged, Emirati-owned chemical tanker was nearby as well, Ambrey said.

The Associated Press could not immediately identify the vessels involved.

The Houthis typically take several hours to claim their assaults and have not yet done so for the assault late Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military’s Central Command said an American and an allied warship shot down five Houthi bomb-carrying drones in the Red Sea on Tuesday night.

The drones originated “from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and (it was) determined they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and to the U.S. Navy and coalition ships in the region,” Central Command said in a statement.

Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.

Despite over a month of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels remain capable of launching significant attacks. Last week, they severely damaged a ship in a crucial strait and downed an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

On Saturday, Central Command said a Houthi attack on a Belize-flagged ship on Feb. 18 caused an 18-mile (29-kilometer) oil slick and warned of the danger of a spill from the vessel’s cargo of fertilizer. The Rubymar, a British-registered, Lebanese-operated cargo vessel, was attacked while sailing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

The Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite group, seized Yemen’s capital in 2014 and have battled a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. Their Zaydi people ran a 1,000-year kingdom in Yemen up until 1962.",Resume146,"['Gambrell Is The News Director For The Gulf', 'Iran For The Associated Press.

The Latest | Families of hostages held in Gaza launch a 4-day march to demand their freedom,"The families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters are launching a four-day march from southern Israel to Jerusalem to demand their loved ones be set free.

The march comes as negotiations are underway in Qatar to bring about a deal between Hamas and Israel that would lead to a cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden has said such a deal was at hand but officials from Israel and Hamas were skeptical of his optimism.

Negotiators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar are working on a framework deal under which Hamas would free some of the dozens of hostages it holds in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a six-week halt in fighting. During the temporary pause, negotiations would continue over the release of the remaining hostages.

The war has unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and sparked global concern over the situation in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost town along the border with Egypt, where 1.4 million Palestinians have sought safety from Israel’s daily bombardments.

Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed after almost five months of Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish in its count between fighters and noncombatants. Israel says it has killed 10,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war began after Hamas-led militants stormed across southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 others hostage.

Currently:

— Israel and Hamas indicate no deal is imminent after Biden signals Gaza cease-fire could be close.

— A deal between Israel and Hamas appears to be taking shape. What would it look like?

— What would a new Palestinian government in the West Bank mean for the war in Gaza?

— U.S. sanctions Iranian deputy commander, Houthi member and ships that transport Iranian oil.

— Qatar’s emir to discuss Gaza and hostages with Macron during a state visit to France.

— Biden implores Congress to avoid a government shutdown, send urgent aid to Ukraine and Israel.

Here’s the latest:

PALESTINIAN OFFICIAL SAYS TIME NOT RIGHT FOR COALITION GOVERNMENT

GENEVA — The Palestinian foreign minister says he believes Hamas supports the creation of a “technocratic government” but insists the militant group shouldn’t be included in any coalition government — for now.

Riyad al-Maliki, speaking two days after Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced his resignation, said that a new government should take responsibility for both the West Bank and Gaza – and that the outgoing one was not seen as “prepared for that responsibility.”

He spoke to reporters Wednesday at the United Nations in Geneva, where he was attending a session of the Human Rights Council amid the blistering Israeli military campaign against Hamas after the deadly Oct. 7 attack in Israel.

The Palestinian Authority, which al-Maliki represents, runs the West Bank but not Gaza, which has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. Hamas has called for all the Palestinian factions to come together to form a government.

Al-Maliki said the time was not ripe for a coalition government, suggesting that key donor countries would boycott it were it to include Hamas.

Later, “when the situation is right,” he said, “we could contemplate that option,” though the priority for now is to end the “insane” war in Gaza and protect the Palestinian people. The Israeli government has called for the destruction of Hamas.

Al-Maliki said a halt to displacement — the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes — and building international political support were important, and “Hamas should understand this.”

“And I do believe that they are in support of the idea to establish today a technocratic government,” he added.

5 ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING HOSTAGES’ FAMILIES AWARDED ISRAEL’S GENESIS PRIZE

JERUSALEM — Five organizations supporting the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been awarded Israel’s prestigious 2024 Genesis prize.

The $1 million award is usually given to a person for their professional achievements, contributions to humanity and commitment to Jewish values. This year, the organization made a different choice with Israelis focusing on the remaining hostages in the Gaza Strip.

“The purpose of this year’s award is not to influence policy, but to raise international awareness of the plight of the hostages and provide humanitarian assistance focused on recovery, rehabilitation, and treatment,” a co-founder of the prize, Stan Polovets, said Wednesday.

The recipients include the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a grassroots group that sprung up in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack to advocate for the return of the abductees.

Roughly 100 of the hostages were freed about 50 days into their captivity. Some 130 others remain in Gaza as negotiations are underway in Qatar. Israel says about a quarter of them are dead.

Prize money will also go to the Jewish Agency’s Fund for Victims of Terror, Lev Echad, Natal-The Israel Trauma and Resiliency Center, and OneFamily.

AID GROUPS MAKE FIRST DELIVERIES TO NORTH GAZA IN A MONTH

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Aid groups this week have made their first deliveries of food in a month to northern Gaza, where the U.N. has warned of worsening starvation among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians amid Israel’s ground operations.

A convoy of 31 trucks carrying food entered northern Gaza on Wednesday, the Israeli military office that oversees Palestinian civilian affairs said. The office, known by the acronym COGAT, said nearly 20 other trucks entered the north on Monday and Tuesday. Associated Press footage showed people carrying sacks of flour from the distribution site.

As of Sunday, the U.N. had been unable to deliver food to northern Gaza since Jan. 23, according to Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that has led the aid effort during the war. On Feb. 18, the World Food Program attempted a delivery to the north for the first time in three weeks but much of the convoy’s cargo was taken on route by desperate Palestinians, and it was only able to distribute a small amount in the north.

Northern Gaza has largely been cut off and much of it has been leveled since Israeli ground troops invaded in late October. Several hundred thousand Palestinians are believed to remain there, and many have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive. The U.N. says 1 in 6 children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, and that 576,000 people across Gaza – a quarter of the population – are a step away from famine.

Since launching its assault on Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing. Despite international calls to allow in more aid, the number of supply trucks entering has dropped dramatically in recent weeks.

The U.N. has called for Israel to open crossings in the north to aid deliveries and guarantee safe corridors for convoys.

THOUSANDS CALL ON VENICE BIENNALE TO EXCLUDE ISRAEL

MILAN — Thousands of artists, curators and critics have signed an open letter calling on the Venice Biennale to exclude the Israeli national pavilion from this year’s contemporary art fair due to the war in Gaza. However, Italy’s culture minister has firmly backed Israel’s participation.

The online letter was signed by more than 17,000 people through Wednesday, including current and past Biennale participants, and Turner Prize winners.

Israel is among 88 national participants in the 60th Venice Biennale of contemporary art which runs from April 20-Nov. 24.

Palestinian artists are participating in collateral events.

OFFICIALS WARN OF DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES IF UNRWA FUNDING IS NOT RESTORED

BEIRUT — If funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is not restored soon, it will have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, officials warned on Wednesday.

“The decision to stop funding UNRWA constitutes a collective punishment for every Palestinian inside Palestine and in the diaspora countries, especially in Lebanon,” Lebanese Member of Parliament Fadi Alame told reporters Wednesday after touring the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp near the southern port city of Sidon with an UNRWA delegation.

Some 250,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon depend on UNRWA for services including healthcare, schooling and cash assistance for the poorest families.

Last month, Israel alleged that 12 UNRWA employees took part in the Oct. 7 attack, prompting the United States and other donors to suspend funding. UNRWA immediately fired the 10 surviving employees and has launched investigations. The agency says if funding is not restored, it will have to halt operations in April.

Dorothee Klaus, UNRWA’s director in Lebanon, said that a halt to the agency’s services would have “security and stability” as well as “humanitarian” consequences.

MANY PREGNANT WOMEN IN GAZA MALNOURISHED, AID GROUP WARNS

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — A humanitarian group operating a clinic in the Gaza Strip says 21% of the pregnant women it has treated in the last three weeks are suffering from malnutrition.

Project Hope, which runs a primary health clinic in the central town of Deir al-Balah, said Wednesday that 11% of the children under 5 it has treated during the same period are also malnourished.

U.N. officials say the Israel-Hamas war has pushed a quarter of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million Palestinians to the brink of famine.

Project Hope says “people have reported eating nothing but white bread as fruit, vegetables, and other nutrient-dense foods are nearly impossible to find or too expensive.”

Malnutrition is especially dangerous for pregnant women and newborns, who require additional nutrients.

Israel says it does not restrict the entry of humanitarian aid, but the number of trucks entering each day is far below the 500 that entered daily before the war.

U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say the distribution of aid within Gaza has largely collapsed because of the difficulty of coordinating shipments with the Israeli military, ongoing fighting in many places and the breakdown of law and order.

Hamas-run police forces have stopped escorting convoys after being targeted by Israeli strikes, and crowds of desperate people have in many cases made it impossible to safely deliver aid.

HAMAS FIRES ROCKETS INTO NORTHERN ISRAEL

JERUSALEM — Hamas has fired rockets into northern Israel in what it says is retaliation for the killing of one of its top leaders in an airstrike in Beirut in January.

Hamas’ armed wing said it fired 40 Grad rockets at an Israeli military base and an army barracks. The Israeli military says it identified around 10 launches and intercepted a number of them. Israeli media said a building was damaged in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona.

The military said it struck the sources of the rocket fire as well as a Hezbollah arsenal and military structures. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either side.

Hezbollah has traded fire with Israel on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. The relatively low-intensity exchanges have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and raised fears of a wider conflict.

Hezbollah is the dominant power in southern Lebanon. Hamas and other Palestinian factions have a smaller presence there and are believed to require at least tacit approval from Hezbollah to carry out military operations.

FAMILIES OF HOSTAGES LAUNCH 4-DAY MARCH TO DEMAND THEIR FREEDOM

TEL AVIV, Israel — The families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters are launching a four-day march from southern Israel to Jerusalem to demand their loved ones be set free.

The march comes as negotiations are underway in Qatar to bring about a deal between Hamas and Israel that would lead to a cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden has said such a deal was at hand but officials from Israel and Hamas were skeptical of his optimism.

Hostages freed in a late-November deal, some of whom still have relatives held in Gaza, are joining the march Wednesday. The march will end near the official residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week.

In its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas abducted roughly 250 people, according to Israeli authorities, including men, women, children and older adults. Roughly 100 were freed about 50 days into their captivity. Some 130 hostages remain and Israel says about a quarter of them are dead.

The plight of the hostages has deeply shaken Israelis, who see in them an enduring symbol of the state’s failure to protect its citizens from Hamas’ assault.

OVER HALF A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE A STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE, U.N. SAYS

UNITED NATIONS – At least one quarter of Gaza’s population – 576,000 people – are one step away from famine, and virtually the entire 2.3 million population needs food, a top U.N. humanitarian official says.

And as grim as the picture is now, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Ramesh Ramasingham told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that “there is every possibility for further deterioration.”

He said one in six children under the age of two in northern Gaza -- the initial target of Israel’s offensive following Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 – are suffering from “acute malnutrition and wasting,” where the body becomes emaciated from a lack of nutrition.

Ramasingham said the rest of Gaza’s population is relying on “woefully inadequate humanitarian food assistance to survive.”

He reiterated the U.N.’s urgent call for a cease-fire. If nothing is done, he said, humanitarian officials fear “widespread famine in Gaza is almost inevitable,” and many more people will die.

He said Israeli military operations, insecurity, extensive restrictions on the entry and delivery of essential goods including food, water and medicine, have decimated food production and agriculture. These factors have also crippled the commercial sector which was a key provider of daily needs in Gaza, he said.

At this stage, he said, “very little will be possible” as long as the fighting keeps going and as an Israeli offensive into southern Gaza looms. Some 1.4 million people who fled the fighting have taken refuge in the area around Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza. Israel has vowed to push into Rafah, which it calls a Hamas stronghold.

TWO BABIES STARVE TO DEATH IN NORTHERN GAZA AS ALARM GROWS OVER WORSENING HUNGER

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Two infants died from dehydration and malnutrition at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza City, said the spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry, Ashraf al-Qidra. He warned that infant mortality threatens to surge.

“Dehydration and malnutrition will kill thousands of children and pregnant women in the Gaza Strip,” he said.

The U.N. Population Fund said the Al Helal Al Emirati maternity hospital in Gaza’s southernmost town of Rafah reported that newborns were dying because mothers were unable to get prenatal or postnatal care.

Premature births are also rising, forcing staff to put four or five newborns in a single incubator. Most of them do not survive, it said, without giving figures on the numbers of deaths.

QATAR’S EMIR WARNS OF ‘RACE AGAINST TIME’ FOR HOSTAGE RELEASE DEAL

PARIS — The emir of Qatar spoke Tuesday of “a race against time” to secure hostage releases as part of the diplomatic push for a cease-fire in Gaza in which his country is playing a key role.

Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke during a state visit to France at a dinner in his honor hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. Al Thani noted that their two countries are working intensely on Gaza diplomacy but also spoke soberingly about the mounting casualties.

“The world sees a genocide of the Palestinian people. Hunger, forced displacement, savage bombardments are used as weapons. And the international community still hasn’t managed to adopt a unified position to end the war in Gaza and provide the strict minimum of protection for children, women and civilians,” the Qatari leader said, speaking through a translator.

South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians, and has filed a case at the United Nations’ top court. Israel adamantly denies the genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in accordance with international law.

“We are in a race against time to bring the hostages back to their families and at the same time we must work to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people,” Al Thani said.",Resume147,[],2024-02-28 09:11:56,"['israeli', 'humanitarian', 'freedom', 'hamas', 'israel', 'families', 'food', 'held', 'latest', 'war', 'military', 'launch', '4day', 'palestinian', 'gaza', 'hostages', 'demand']",ap_news_articles
Dubai’s sky-high aspirations find a new outlet as it hosts a jet suit race for ‘Iron Man’ pilots,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Pilots lined up on a runway in Dubai on Wednesday and fired up their seven jet engines with an ear-splitting roar. But they weren’t preparing to fly an airplane — they were the aircraft.

This city-state in the United Arab Emirates, known for being home to the world’s tallest building and other wonders, hosted what it called its first-ever jet suit race. Racers zipped along a route with the skyscrapers of Dubai Marina looming behind them, controlling the jet engines on their hands and their backs.

And if it sounds like Iron Man, the Marvel comic book character made internationally known by actor Robert Downey Jr., the pilots say it is exactly like that.

“The closest analogy would be that dream of flying ... and then go wherever your mind is taking you,” said Richard Browning, the founder and chief test pilot for Gravity Industries, the firm that put on the race with Dubai. “And yes, the world of Marvel superheroes and DC Comics, they have created that dream book with CGI, and we’ve got the closest I think anybody’s ever got to to delivering that for real.”

Gravity previously drew worldwide attention when it equipped one of its jet suits on a U.K. Royal Marine, who landed on a ship at sea several years ago. In the time since, they’ve traveled widely with the suits and pursued other military applications for them before coming up with the idea of a competition with the Dubai Sports Council.

The races on Wednesday saw pilots wear 1,500-horsepower jet suits, using the same kind of fuel that powers Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates’ Airbus A380s and Boeing 777 aircraft. Pilots lined up on a runway used at the Dubai Marina by Skydive Dubai, the thrill-seeking firm associated with the sheikhdom’s Crown Prince Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, with some parachutists coming down as they prepared their jet packs.

Then came what pilot Issa Kalfon referred to as “the moment of truth.” The engines roared and pilots jumped and leaned forward. And like a helicopter takes off, so too did the pilots as they sped around obstacles in a water channel near the site. Organizers said they picked the water site to allow for higher speeds and for safety as the pilots skimmed a short distance above the water.

The jet suit currently can reach speeds of 80 mph (128 kph), Gravity says. The pilots did pick up speed during their heats, with two actually bumping into each other but remaining in the air as a crowd watched in wonder.

“It’s pretty amazing to see that they can do this in Dubai and they have these guys flying over the water,” said Jennifer Ross, 50, a U.S. citizen from Houston who now lives in Dubai. “It’s kind of like astronauts flying around in space.”

While known for its beaches, bars and bazaars, Dubai has long been a city fascinated by flight, particularly as it hosts the world’s busiest airport for international travel. The city has been pursuing for years the idea of flying taxis as well.

Dubai also has grown into an adventure capital as well. XDubai, which also is associated with Sheikh Hamdan, has run zip line attractions over Dubai Marina and its downtown by the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building.

There are risks, however. In 2020, Vincent Reffet, one of Dubai’s original “Jetmen” as part of a separate venture, died in a crash during training after gaining fame for once flying alongside an Emirates double-decker A380.

Kalfon, who ended up winning the race and hoisting a golden jet turbine, acknowledged getting nervous before his flights, but described the jet suit as safe and easy to handle.

“Everything’s hot, it’s running, the engines are screaming at you,” Kalfon said. “And the flag drops, and it’s just — you absolutely go for it.”

There was one crash during Wednesday’s race. Emirati pilot Ahmed al-Shehhi smashed into the water during his heat, going feet first but immediately popping back up to give a thumbs-up to rescuers. An announcer described him as having just 12 days of training before the race. The smell of jet fuel came off his unit as technicians carried off a boat afterward.

Meanwhile, onlookers gaped at the jet suits, with several saying they couldn’t wait to go for a ride themselves.

“You can see the best show you can ever see in Dubai because people are flying — they are flying in the sky,” said Pratik Vyas, 35, of Gujarat, India, who works in an import-export business. “It’s a next-level tech. It’s really, really nice because if you’re a big fan of Iron Man, you know, Tony Stark, it’s Iron Man tech.”",Resume148,"['Gambrell Is The News Director For The Gulf', 'Iran For The Associated Press.

"Turkish drones kill 3 in an attack on a local Christian militia in northeastern Syria, officials say","BEIRUT (AP) — Turkish drone strikes in northeastern Syria on Wednesday killed at least three members of a local Christian force and wounded others, including civilians, a Kurdish official and a Syrian opposition war monitor said.

Also on Wednesday, in the southern Syrian city of Sweida, security forces opened fire at protesters angry over the country’s worsening economy as they tried to break into the offices of President Bashar Assad’s ruling Baath Party. A 52-year-old man was shot in the chest and later died of his wounds.

There was no immediate comment from Ankara on Wednesday’s airstrikes. Turkey has been attacking Kurdish fighters in Syria for years but attacks on the fighters from the country’s Christian minority have been rare.

The force that was targeted, the local Christian Syriac police known as Sutoro, works under the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

Siamand Ali of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces told The Associated Press that the Turkish drones initially hit three Suturo vehicles near the northeastern town of Malikiyah. When a fourth vehicle, a pick-up truck, arrived at the scene to retrieve the casualties from the strike, it also came under attack, he said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said three Suturo police members were killed, as well as one civilian.

The Observatory said the attack was the latest of 65 such strikes so far this year in northeastern Syria that have killed 18 people, mostly Kurdish fighters.

Turkey often launches strikes against targets in Syria and Iraq it believes to be affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK — a banned Kurdish separatist group that has waged an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey says that the main Kurdish militia in Syria, known as People’s Defense Units, or YPG, is an affiliate of the PKK.

Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency however, reported on Tuesday that the Turkish intelligence agency, MIT, had killed a senior Kurdish fighter member in an operation in the northern Syrian town of Qamishli.

The report identified the woman operative as Emine Seyid Ahmed, a Syrian national, who allegedly went by the code name of “Azadi Derik.”

She reportedly joined the Kurdish Women Protection Units, or YPJ, in 2011 and allegedly planned a number of attacks against Turkish security forces as well as cross-border missile attacks targeting civilians in Turkey, Anadolu reported.

In Sweida, the local activist media collective Suwayda24 identified the protester killed during Wednesday’s anti-government rally as Jawad al-Barouki.

Suwayda24 chief editor Rayan Maarouf told The Associated Press that the man was rushed to the Sweida National Hospital, but died shortly after at the intensive care unit as the there was no pulmonary doctor at the ICU.

The death marked the first fatality in anti-government protests in Sweida, which erupted last August, with the demonstrators mainly from the country’s ethnic Druze minority.

The protests, spurred by surging inflation, quickly turned to calls for the ouster of Assad’s government and harked back to the first rallies during the 2011 uprising that later spiraled into Syria’s civil war.

ICC awards $56 million in reparations to thousands of victims of convicted Ugandan rebel commander,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Judges at the International Criminal Court on Wednesday granted reparations of more than 52 million euros ($56 million) to thousands of victims of a convicted commander in the shadowy Ugandan rebel group the Lord’s Resistance Army.

The nearly 50,000 victims covered by the order included former child soldiers and children born as a result of rapes and forced pregnancies.

Dominic Ongwen was convicted three years ago of 61 offenses, including murders, rapes, forced marriages and recruiting child soldiers in 2002-2005. An ICC appeals panel upheld his convictions and 25-year sentence in late 2022, setting the stage for an order for reparations.

“Tens of thousands of individuals suffered tremendous harm due to the unimaginable atrocities committed” as rebel fighters led by Ongwen attacked four camps for displaced people in northern Uganda, said Presiding Judge Bertram Schmitt.

“Similarly, over 100 women and girls and thousands of children, boys and girls under the age of 15 suffered profound, multifaceted harm as a result of being kidnapped. Many were later subjected to sexual and gender based crimes and/or forced to serve as LRA soldiers, being kept in captivity with cruel methods of physical and psychological coercion,” he added.

Ongwen was not in court for the reparations hearing. While he is considered liable for the reparations, the court ruled that he is indigent and said the reparations will be paid by a trust fund for victims set up by the court’s member states.

Schmitt urged “states, organisations, corporations and private individuals to support the trust funds for victims’ mission and efforts and contribute to its fundraising activities.”

He said victims would each receive 750 euros ($812) as a “symbolic award” while other reparations would come in the form of community-based rehabilitation programs.

Evidence at Ongwen’s trial established that female civilians captured by the LRA were turned into sex slaves and wives for fighters. The LRA made children into soldiers. Men, women and children were murdered in attacks on camps for internally displaced people.

“The chamber concludes that the direct victims of the attacks, the direct victims of sexual and gender based crimes and the children born out of those crimes, as well as the former child soldiers, suffered serious and long-lasting physical, moral and material harm,” Schmitt said.

The LRA began its attacks in Uganda in the 1980s, when one of the court’s most-wanted fugitives, Joseph Kony, sought to overthrow the government. After being pushed out of Uganda, the militia terrorized villages in Congo, Central Africa Republic and South Sudan.

Ongwen was among those abducted by the militia led by Kony. As a 9-year-old boy, he was transformed into a child soldier and later a senior commander responsible for attacks on camps for displaced civilians in northern Uganda in the early 2000s.

Defense lawyers portrayed him as a victim of LRA atrocities. But the judge who presided over his trial called Ongwen “a fully responsible adult” when he committed his crimes.

Activists welcomed his convictions for offenses against women, which included rape, forced pregnancy and sexual slavery.

Kony, whose whereabouts are unknown, faces 36 charges, including murder, torture, rape, persecution and enslavement. Prosecutors are seeking to hold a hearing into the evidence against him at the court in Kony’s absence.

The LRA leader was thrust into the global spotlight in 2012 when a video about his crimes went viral. Despite the attention and international efforts to capture him, he remains at large.

Senegalese leaders propose June elections after court rejects president’s 10 month delay,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A group of Senegalese civic and religious leaders proposed holding elections in early June, the first new date offered since the president attempted to push elections back to the end of the year.

President Macky Sall who faces term limits at the end of his second terms, said in early February he was postponing an election for 10 months, just weeks before it was set to take place on Feb. 25.

But Senegal’s highest election authority, the Constitutional Council, rejected that move and ordered the government to set a new election date as soon as possible.

Sall called for a two-day national dialogue earlier this week, aiming at fostering trust among the candidates and the population. Civil, political and religious leaders attended, but almost all of the candidates on the ballot refused to participate. On Tuesday, the panel proposed holding the vote on June 2.

Sall has said that he will step down by April 2, which is the end of his current term, but it’s unclear who will take over if elections are not held before that.

Senegal has been seen as a rare stable democracy in a region rife with coups. The delay of the vote has sparked deadly protests across the country.

The panel called for the Constitutional Council to review decisions that blocked candidates including Karim Wade, an opposition leader and son of former Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, from the ballot.

The election authority disqualified Wade because he previously held dual citizenship. He renounced his French nationality in order to run.

Sall has defended his decision to delay elections, but has accepted the Council’s ruling and attempted to calm the situation. At the launch of the dialogue he said he would propose a general amnesty law addressing the protests, in which hundreds of people were jailed.

It wasn’t immediately clear who would be freed if the amnesty was enacted or how it might affect Ousmane Sonko, a popular opposition leader who is currently in jail.",Resume151,[],2024-02-28 10:20:33,"['propose', 'presidents', 'elections', 'senegalese', 'election', 'candidates', 'set', 'leaders', 'court', 'term', 'vote', 'month', 'end', 'religious', 'delay', 'rejects', 'wade']",ap_news_articles
Nigeria’s union workers are on strike nationwide over soaring inflation and unmet promises,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s government employees and other union workers began a new nationwide strike Tuesday that threatened to shut down key services while people are angry about soaring inflation and growing economic pain.

Since assuming office in Africa’s most populous country last year, President Bola Tinubu has enacted policies that include doing away with fuel subsidies and unifying the country’s multiple exchange rates, leading to a devaluation of the naira against the dollar.

Gasoline prices have more than doubled and inflation has shot up as a result, reaching close to 30% last month, the highest in nearly three decades, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

“We are hungry. There is nobody that doesn’t know this,” said Joe Ajaero, president of the Nigerian Labor Congress.

Others said the protest was the only way to get the government’s attention.

“Things are getting out of hand,” said Christian Omeje, a shop owner in the capital, Abuja. “Prices keep soaring, the aid the government said it would dole out has not been provided.”

This is just the latest strike action. In October, government labor unions reached a deal with the government to end strikes in return for monthly stipends and subsidies to cushion the blow of the new policies. Still, the unrest continued.

Unions say the government has failed to deliver on promises that included a monthly wage increase of approximately $20 for all workers for six months and payments of approximately $15 for three months to millions of vulnerable households.

A pledge to roll out gas-powered buses for mass transit last year also failed to materialize.

Most services appeared to continue Tuesday with a reduced workforce.

An Italian family of three is back in Rome following two years of captivity in Mali,"ROME (AP) — Italy’s foreign minister was on hand Tuesday for the arrival in Rome of an Italian family of three just hours after their release from two years of captivity in the African nation of Mali.

The family, identified as Rocco Langone, his wife Maria Caivano and an adult son, Giovanni Langone, were kidnapped from their home in the city of Koutiala, southeast of the Mali capital, by a militant group affiliated with al-Qaida. Italian authorities said the family had lived in Mali for years as part of a “well-integrated community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that the family members were all in good condition. Besides Tajani, they were met by another adult son, Daniele Langone.

“I do not wish to anyone to go through what I went through,’’ Daniele Langone told reporters. “I am so grateful for all that has been done for me and for my family.”",Resume153,[],2024-02-27 18:39:16,"['italian', 'adult', 'minister', 'langone', 'family', 'rome', 'following', 'tajani', 'son', 'mali', 'captivity', 'daniele']",ap_news_articles
Wildfire grows into 2nd-largest in Texas history and briefly shuts down nuclear weapons facility,"A fast-moving wildfire burning through the Texas Panhandle grew into the second-largest blaze in state history Wednesday, forcing evacuations and triggering power outages as firefighters struggled to contain the widening flames.

The sprawling blaze was part of a cluster of fires that burned out of control and threatened rural towns, where local officials spent the night shutting down roads and urging residents to leave their homes. The largest of the fires — which grew to nearly 800 square miles — jumped into parts of neighboring Oklahoma and remained completely uncontained as dawn broke, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.

Officials were starting to assess the damage Wednesday and warned it could be extensive. The town of Fritch, with a population of less than 2,000, appeared to be hit hard.

The people in that area are probably not “prepared for what they’re going to see if they pull into town,” Hutchinson County Emergency Management spokesperson Deidra Thomas said in a social media livestream. She compared the damage to a tornado.

The town remained unsafe for people to return, she said.

Authorities have not said what ignited the fires, but strong winds, dry grass and unseasonably warm temperatures have fed the blazes. Near Borger, a community of about 13,000 people, emergency officials at one point late Tuesday answered questions from panicked residents during a Facebook livestream and told them to get ready to leave if they had not already.

“It was like a ring of fire around Borger. There was no way out ... all four main roads were closed,” said Adrianna Hill, 28, whose home was within about a mile of the fire. She said a northern wind that blew the fire in the opposite direction “saved our butts.”

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties. The encroaching flames caused the main facility that disassembles America’s nuclear arsenal to pause operations Tuesday night, but it was open for normal work on Wednesday.

The blazes tore through sparsely populated counties on the vast, high plains that are punctuated by cattle ranches and oil rigs. The main fire, known as the Smoke House Creek Fire, had grown to more than half the size of the state of Rhode Island. It is five times the size it was on Monday, when it began.

The weather forecast provided some hope for firefighters — cooler temperatures, less wind and possibly rain on Thursday. But for now, the situation was dire in some areas.

Sustained winds of up to 45 mph (72 kph), with gusts of up to 70 mph (113 kph), caused the fires that were spreading east to turn south, threatening new areas, forecasters said. But winds calmed down after a cold front came through Tuesday evening, said Peter Vanden Bosch, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Amarillo, Texas.

“Fortunately, the winds have weakened quite significantly,” Vanden Bosch said Wednesday. Breezy conditions were expected again Friday, and critical fire weather could return by the weekend, he said.

As the evacuation orders mounted Tuesday, county and city officials implored residents to turn on emergency alert services on their cellphones and be ready to evacuate immediately.

An unknown number of homes and other structures in the county were damaged or destroyed, local emergency officials said.

The Pantex plant, northeast of Amarillo, evacuated nonessential staff Tuesday night out of an “abundance of caution,” said Laef Pendergraft, a spokesperson for National Nuclear Security Administration’s production office at Pantex. Firefighters remained in case of an emergency.

The plant has long been the main U.S. site for both assembling and disassembling atomic bombs. It completed its last new bomb in 1991 and has dismantled thousands since.

Pantex tweeted early Wednesday that the facility “is open for normal day shift operations” and that all personnel were to report for duty according to their assigned schedule.

As the fires raged Tuesday, evacuations were ordered in several towns in a swath northeast of Amarillo.

The Smokehouse Creek Fire spread from Texas into neighboring Roger Mills County in western Oklahoma, where officials encouraged people in the Durham area to flee. Officials did not know yet how large the fire was in Oklahoma. The Roger Mills County emergency management director did not immediately return phone calls for comment.

An unrelated fire in Ellis County, Oklahoma, on the Oklahoma-Texas state line, led Tuesday to the evacuations of the towns of Shattuck and Gage. The evacuation order was lifted hours later, according to county Emergency Management Director Riley Latta. The fire had unknown origins and burned an estimated 47 square miles, according to the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.

Texas state Sen. Kevin Sparks said an evacuation order was issued for Canadian, a town of about 2,000 people about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Amarillo. Later Tuesday, the Hemphill County Sheriff’s Office urged anyone who remained in Canadian to shelter in place or at the high school gym because roads were closed.

On Tuesday evening, the fires were 20 to 25 miles (32 to 40 kilometers) from Amarillo, and wind was blowing smoke into the city, which could affect people with respiratory issues, National Weather Service officials said.

The weather service issued red-flag warnings and fire-danger alerts for several other states through the midsection of the country, as winds of over 40 mph (64 kph) combined with warm temperatures, low humidity and dry winter vegetation to make conditions ripe for wildfires.

In central Nebraska, a mower sparked a prairie fire that burned a huge swath of grassland roughly the size of the state’s largest city of Omaha, state officials said Tuesday.

"About as many abortions are happening in the US monthly as before Roe was overturned, report finds","The number of abortions performed each month is about the same as before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion more than a year and a half ago, a new report finds.

The latest edition of the #WeCount report conducted for the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit organization that promotes research on abortion and contraception, finds that between 81,150 and 88,620 abortions took place each month from July through September of last year, the most recent period for which survey results are available. Those numbers are just slightly lower than the monthly average of about 86,800 from April through June 2022, before Roe and just after was overturned.

But abortion data is seasonal, and the same survey found more abortions across the U.S. in the spring months of 2023 than it did in the period the year before leading up to the court’s decision.

The report also finds that prescriptions of abortion pills by telemedicine have become common, accounting for about one in every six abortions in the most recent three months of survey results.

“Even when a state bans abortion, people continue to need and seek abortion care,” Alison Norris, a professor at Ohio State University’s College of Public Health and one of the co-chairs of the study, said in a statement. “We can’t let the overall consistent number of abortions nationally obscure the incredible unmet need and disastrous impact of abortion bans on people who already have the least access.”

The report estimates that if states had not been allowed to ban abortion, there would have been a total of 120,000 more during the survey period in the 14 states where bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy are now in place.

Although the number of monthly abortions has dropped to nearly zero in states with bans, they have risen in states that allow abortion, including Florida, Illinois and Kansas, which border states with bans.

The tracking effort collects monthly data from providers across the country, creating a snapshot of abortion trends after Roe v. Wade was overturned. In some states, a portion of the data is estimated. The effort makes data public with less than a six-month lag, giving a picture of trends far faster than annual reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where the most recent report covers abortion in 2021.

The report does not cover self-managed abortions obtained outside the formal health care system.

The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling in June 2022 brought about immediate change in state policies. Currently, 14 states are enforcing bans on abortion in all stages of pregnancy and two more have bans that kick in after the first six weeks — often before women realize they’re pregnant. Other Republican-controlled states have imposed lighter restrictions. Enforcement of some bans has been put on hold by courts.

Meanwhile, most Democrat-controlled states have taken steps to protect access to abortion. Several have executive orders or laws that seek to keep states with bans from reaching across state lines in abortion-related investigations. And five — Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington — have laws seeking to protect providers who give abortion care via telehealth.

The report’s total numbers includes cases where providers in those states prescribed medication abortion to patients in states with abortion bans or restrictions on the pill versions in its national count but does not break down how many there were by state.

"Tornado warnings: Severe weather hits Ohio, Illinois, Michigan","Severe thunderstorms that may have spawned a rare February tornado outbreak toppled trees, cut power and damaged homes in the Chicago area and other parts of the Great Lakes following a spell of summerlike, sometimes record temperatures.

In Michigan’s Grand Blanc Township, near Flint, winds damaged subdivisions, tore up trees and uprooted gas lines in the wee hours of Wednesday. Police officers said they saw a tornado, but weather authorities have yet to confirm that.

Police and firefighters moved residents in an area of gas leaks to a firehouse, and they were allowed to return when a utility made repairs, authorities said.

“There are still numerous reports of wires down in the area,” police said. “While there is significant damage to houses in the area, no one was hurt.”

More than 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the southwest, a possible tornado damaged homes and barns and knocked down trees and power lines in Calhoun County’s Lee Township, the sheriff’s office said on Facebook. Crews cleared roads for rescue teams, but no injuries were reported.

Warning sirens jolted residents of central Ohio awake as a possible tornado hit near Columbus. Significant damage was reported at an airport in Madison County, between Dayton and Columbus. Toppled trees closed roads in the area until debris could be cleared.

AP AUDIO: Tornadoes in February? In the Great Lakes? Storms leave a trail of destruction. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on severe weather damage in parts of the Great Lakes.

At one point, more than 50,000 customers in Ohio and Michigan lacked power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us.

In Geneva, in Chicago’s western suburbs, storms Tuesday evening uprooted trees and left some homes with broken windows and shorn-off doors, said Fire Chief Mike Antenore.

Geneva resident Rebecca Harrington said the storm “cycloned” into her home and collapsed its foyer area.

“The back of my house is sort of hanging off,” Harrington told WGN-TV, which reported no injuries.

The storms followed unusual warmth across Illinois in recent days, the National Weather Service office said. They were followed Wednesday by a return to winter weather, with snow and temperatures in the 20s.

If a tornado is confirmed in Grand Blanc Township, it would be only the second February tornado for that part of Michigan since recordkeeping began in 1950, following one in Wayne County on Feb. 28, 1974, said meteorologist Dave Kook, of the weather service’s Detroit office.

The warm weather and severe storms, including hail up to an inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter, on Tuesday and Wednesday are unusual for the area this time of the year, Kook said.

“This is not typical of late February by any means,” he said. “Basically, it’s kind of a month ahead of schedule for southeast Michigan.”

The weather service office that covers southwestern and central Ohio has recorded winter tornadoes almost every year since 2012.

Weather service teams will conduct surveys to confirm tornado reports around the region. ___

Biden administration offering $85M in grants to help boost jobs in violence-plagued communities,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is preparing to offer $85 million in federal grants meant to improve job opportunities for youth in communities affected by gun violence and crime.

It’s part of an administration effort to address not just the immediate needs of communities following acts of violence, but also to promote longer-term recovery and resilience.

Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, was expected to speak about the grants on Wednesday.

“It’s clear that with gun violence now being the number one cause of premature death for all youth in America, that we must take an all-of-government public health approach to address this crisis,” said Greg Jackson, deputy director of the White House office of gun violence prevention.

President Joe Biden has called gun violence “the ultimate superstorm,” affecting not just victims but the everyday lives of community members. His administration says the response should better resemble how the government acts after natural disasters.

Jackson said the grants will help provide key resources for community organizations and government leaders and will invest in those most at risk for violence. He said it was a way to address both “the lack of economic opportunity and the crisis of gun violence.”

The grants will be open to nonprofits, governments and civic leaders to fund education, skills training and paid work experience.

Lower auto prices are giving Americans a break after years of inflation,"DETROIT (AP) — Price increases for cars and trucks in the United States, which helped fuel inflation for nearly three years, are slowing and in some cases falling, helping cool overall inflation and giving frustrated Americans more hope of finding an affordable vehicle.

Behind the price slowdown is a vastly expanded number of vehicles on dealer lots after years of severe shortages. With more autos available, the pressures that had sent prices surging have eased. At the end of January, American dealers had 2.61 million new cars, trucks and SUVs on their lots, according to Cox Automotive. By contrast, the supply a year ago was just 1.74 million.

Though inventories of new autos are still well below the roughly 4 million level that prevailed before the pandemic, analysts and dealers say the rising availability suggests that 2024 will be the most affordable year of the past five in which to buy a new car or truck.

“When the lots are empty, there’s not much of a bargaining position from a consumer standpoint,” said Glenn Mears, owner of a four-dealership group around Canton and Dover, Ohio. “But now that we have inventory, it’s much more competitive. Much more like it has been historically.”

AP AUDIO: Lower auto prices are finally giving Americans a break after years of inflationary increases. AP correspondent Seth Sutel reports that after pandemic shortages, automobile price hikes are slowing.

The price spikes that followed the 2020 pandemic were caused mainly by a worldwide shortage of computer chips, which are vital to auto manufacturing and had forced plants to curb production. As vehicle availability shrank, prices soared. By 2021, some dealers had no new cars at all in stock. Many frustrated buyers turned instead to the used market. The resulting surge in demand for used cars caused those prices to surge, too, elbowing many people out of the auto market entirely.

But with computer chips now abundant, auto production is rising steadily, especially since the United Auto Workers returned to work after strikes last fall.

The average price paid for a new vehicle in the United States fell 1.2% in January from a year earlier, to $47,338, according to data collected by Edmunds.com. That’s down 2.4% from a peak of $48,516 set in December 2022. Though the drop is relatively modest, analysts predict that prices will keep falling this year, especially for new vehicles, as availability grows and automakers are compelled to lower prices.

The average price of a used vehicle — $27,297 as of last month — is down 3% from a year ago and 12% below the peak of $31,095 in April 2022. Analysts expect used-auto prices to fall further before rising slightly once the peak buying season resumes in the spring.

In January, automaker discounts on new vehicles, including rebates and low-interest financing, averaged $1,469 per vehicle — five times what they had averaged a year earlier.

“What we anticipate is that there will be significantly more discounting, more incentives,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive. “We’re already seeing that.”

When Gary Morrow of Pickerington, Ohio, started shopping for a new SUV earlier this month, he wasn’t prepared to receive any discount at all. But he was pleasantly surprised when Larry Scott’s dealership in Columbus, Ohio, offered a $500 cash incentive, plus a five-year 4% loan — far below the roughly 7% average new-car loan — on a Hyundai Palisade SUV that cost him around $47,000.

“You can’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” said Morrow, a retired teacher. “I was pretty comfortable with the final figure.”

Thanks to the lower-cost financing, Morrow said he managed to keep some money he had set aside for the new vehicle invested, where he hopes it will deliver a higher return than the rate on his 4% loan.

New vehicle prices didn’t rise at all from December to January, government figures show. Still, they’re up more than 21% since the start of 2020, when the pandemic erupted and triggered severe parts shortages. For used vehicles, the average price dropped 3.3% last month, though at just over $27,000 it remains 32% above the pre-pandemic average.

In contrast to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, the average price of an electric vehicle actually rose 2% during the past year to $60,630, according to Edmunds, despite a growing supply of EVs. But analysts say that sharp price cuts by Ford and Tesla, along with the introduction of some more affordable models, should help lower average EV prices.

Scott, the general manager of Germain Hyundai in Columbus, said that before the pandemic, he typically had 400 to 500 vehicles on hand. That figure plummeted at the height of the computer chip shortage to just 30-50 vehicles during some months. By last year, his average supply was about 150. Now, it’s up to 250 to 275 — enough to compete with rival dealers who, like Scott, are offering discounts.

Even with prices edging down, Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, doesn’t foresee sales of new vehicles rising dramatically this year. Still-high loan rates mean that monthly payments remain burdensome for many at a time when buyers are seeking affordable options. Edmunds envisions U.S. sales rising a modest 0.5%, to about 15.7 million, this year, still short of pre-pandemic highs around 17 million.

Automakers, Drury said, are offering discounts mainly for slower-selling vehicles. But he said he thinks discounting will extend to additional vehicles in the coming months, meaning that buyers who don’t need a vehicle right now might be wise to wait.

Unlike with new vehicles, there’s still a limited supply of used cars, trucks and SUVs, which will likely serve to limit any price declines. That’s mainly because the sluggish sales of new cars since 2020 has resulted in fewer trade-ins and vehicles coming off leases into the market, thereby keeping used-vehicle supplies tight.

Prices for some 1- and 2-year-old vehicles, Drury said, are nearly as expensive as the prices automakers are charging for new vehicles. Low-mileage 2023 Honda Accord EX models, for example, are being advertised at close to $28,000. At $31,000, the base price for a new one, including shipping, is not much more.

With an average used-vehicle loan rate of 11.5%, Drury said, it might be more cost-effective to pay slightly more for a new vehicle in order to secure a reduced rate from an automaker’s finance arm.

"Chad says opposition group attacked security agency in capital, a day after election date was set","N’DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Several people were killed in an attack on the national security agency in Chad’s capital, officials said on Wednesday.

Opposition group The Socialist Party Without Borders attacked The agency, known as ANSE, D’jamena, government spokesman Abderaman Koulamallah in a statement. The group is led by Yaya Dillo, the current president’s cousin and a strong contender in the upcoming election.

Koulamallah said, “the situation is now totally under control” but did not reveal the exact number of people killed. He said some were arrested and others were being pursued.

In the same statement, the government said that earlier the party’s finance secretary tried to assassinate the president of the supreme court, which led to his arrest.

Chad’s interim president, Mahamat Deby Itno, seized power after his father who ran the country for more than three decades was killed fighting rebels in 2021. Last year, the government announced it was extending the 18-month transition for two more years, which led to protests across the country.

"Traces of toxic gas found during evacuation of Swedish security agency, local media report","STOCKHOLM (AP) — Traces of a toxic, colorless gas were found at the headquarters of Sweden’s security agency where a suspected gas leak last week forced authorities to evacuate some 500 people from the facility, a local paper reported Wednesday.

The daily Svenska Dagbladet newspaper said authorities had found traces of phosgene. The gas has a strong odor that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I.

There were no immediate comments from officials.

On Friday, eight people from the headquarters in Solna, just north of Stockholm, were hospitalized, following the evacuation. There were no reports of anyone being seriously injured.

Those admitted to the hospital suffered breathing problems, authorities said. Some of them were officers who smelled the gas when they arrived at the scene, police said.

Images showed first responders and police officers wearing gas masks at the security headquarters. Swedish media reported that a zone measuring 500 meters (about 547 yards) in diameter was set up protectively.

Authorities asked people living near the Swedish security agency, known by its acronym SAPO, to keep their windows closed at the time.

After the evacuation, SAPO said Friday that the rescue service “had established that there was no gas either inside the premises or outside the building.”",Resume160,[],2024-02-28 15:44:42,"['toxic', 'report', 'headquarters', 'officers', 'local', 'stockholm', 'gas', 'agency', 'swedish', 'authorities', 'evacuation', 'sapo', 'security', 'traces', 'media', 'reported']",ap_news_articles
Northern Ireland judge rules that amnesty law for ‘the Troubles’ breaches human rights,"LONDON (AP) — A new law that gives immunity from prosecution for most offenses committed during Northern Ireland’s decades of sectarian violence is not compliant with human rights, a judge in Belfast ruled Wednesday.

The British government’s Legacy and Reconciliation Bill, passed in September, stops most prosecutions for alleged killings by militant groups and British soldiers during “the Troubles” — the period in Northern Ireland from the 1960s to the ‘90s in which more than 3,500 people died.

The law was widely opposed by people in Northern Ireland and the Irish government. Critics say it shuts down access to justice for victims and survivors.

Ruling in a legal challenge brought by victims and their families, Justice Adrian Colton said the law’s provision for conditional immunity from prosecution breaches the European Convention on Human Rights.

The judge also said the law will not contribute to peace in Northern Ireland.

“There is no evidence that the granting of immunity under the act will in any way contribute to reconciliation in Northern Ireland; indeed the evidence is to the contrary,” he said at Belfast High Court.

However, Colton ruled that a new body set up to probe Troubles killings, to be loosely modeled on South Africa’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, could carry out human rights-compliant investigations.

Britain’s government said it will consider the ruling carefully but added that it remained “committed” to implementing the legacy bill.

Amnesty International said there were “significant questions” for Britain’s government to answer, and urged officials to repeal the law.

“The core part of this legislation was the immunity from prosecution. That has now been stripped out, struck out from the law. So it’s back to Parliament and back to the U.K. government about what they are going to do next,” said Grainne Teggart of Amnesty.

In December, the Irish government launched a separate legal case against Britain’s government over the Troubles law at the European Court of Human Rights.

The 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended violence in Northern Ireland, and British authorities say the law will allow the country to move on.

But those who lost loved ones have said the law would airbrush the past and allow killers to get away with murder. Dozens of legacy inquests have yet to be heard.

Martina Dillon, who was among those who brought the case, said she will “fight until I get truth and justice.” Her husband, Seamus, was shot dead in 1997.

Ongoing lawsuits include a case brought against former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams by three people who were wounded in bombings attributed to the Irish Republican Army more than 50 years ago.

Committee says 285 people and organizations nominated for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Wednesday it registered 285 candidates for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize by the Feb. 1 deadline, down from 2023 when it received 351 valid nominations.

The names of the 196 individuals and 89 organizations were not released, in accordance with committee practice.

Last year, the Nobel Institute received 351 valid nominations — 259 individuals and 92 organizations. The Oslo-based committee said the highest number ever received was in 2016 when they got 376 candidates.

A vast group of people can submit a nomination for the prize: heads of state or politicians serving at a national level, university professors, directors of foreign policy institutes, past Nobel Prize recipients and members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

However, those doing the nominating may choose to make it public, raising publicity both for the nominee and the proposer.

For this year, entries include peace activists connected to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine among others.

Academics at the Free University Amsterdam have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians.

The International Peace Bureau, which won the prize in 1910, said it had nominated The Russian Movement of Conscientious Objectors and The Ukrainian Pacifist Movement for their commitment to the protection of conscientious objectors to violence, particularly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The Belarusian organization Our House, was also nominated for the same reason.

The 2023 prize was given to imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for campaigning for women’s rights and democracy in her country. Her teenage children accepted the award on her behalf.

Paris City Hall says no Olympic Games policing plans were lost in theft of a worker’s computer gear,"PARIS (AP) — Paris City Hall said Wednesday that no policing plans for the upcoming Olympic Games were lost in the theft of computer gear reported by one of its employees.

A City Hall statement said: “Initial checks established that the worker didn’t possess any information relating to the organization and deployment of law enforcement during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.”

French broadcaster BFMTV first reported Tuesday evening that a computer and USB keys containing Olympic Games security plans for Paris City Hall were stolen aboard a train at the French capital’s Gare du Nord station.

BFM said one of the USB keys was encrypted and stored security plans relating to roads and traffic for the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Games.

In a city repeatedly hit by deadly extremist attacks, security is the biggest challenge for Paris Games organizers.

The Paris prosecutor’s office on Wednesday described media coverage of the theft as “hasty.” It said a City Hall engineer had lost a bag at Gare du Nord on Monday and reported that it contained a USB key used for work.

“However, it is important to specify that this key only contained notes related to traffic in Paris during the Olympic Games, and not on sensitive security plans,” the prosecutor’s office said.

City Hall’s statement said the worker’s computer gear “contained notes for internal use,” concerning the employee’s IT-related work for the Paris traffic department.

It said an investigation is underway into the “proven breaches of internal security procedures” and that depending on its findings, “sanctions will be taken.”

Asylum seekers in Europe reached a 7-year high last year. Syrians and Afghans file most claims,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The number of asylum seekers in Europe reached a seven-year high last year, with more than 1.1 million people applying for international protection in 2023, most of them Syrian nationals, the European Union said Wednesday.

The increase in asylum seekers and other migrants is a divisive issue in many European countries, pitting those who say more should be turned away at borders against those who feel the continent should continue to welcome people fleeing persecution.

The EU asylum agency’s figures are compiled from claims in the 27 countries of the bloc, plus Norway and Switzerland.

The agency said 181,000 Syrians sought asylum last year — a 38% rise from 2022 — while Afghan nationals made up the second biggest group, with 114,000 claims filed, though the number of Afghans was 11% down, compared to 2022.

Syrians stood the best chance of all nationalities of having their claims accepted, the agency said.

More Palestinians lodged asylum applications last year — nearly 11,600, or two thirds higher than the year before.

Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict, fear for their safety or due to possible persecution over their race, gender, sexuality or religion. In Europe, people who apply because they are seeking jobs or better lives are often refused entry.

Germany received the most applications by far last year, with 334,000 people seeking asylum, but Cyprus was under the greatest pressure from migrants wanting to stay on the island, relative to its population. The agency said 12,000 people applied for protection in Cyprus in 2023.

France received 167,000 applications, Spain 162,000, and Italy 136,000. Combined with Germany, the four received more than two thirds of all the applications made in 2023.

People from Turkey — a candidate to become an EU member, though its talks are at a standstill over concerns about democratic and human rights standards — also applied in far greater number, with 101,000 asylum applications by Turkish citizens, up 82% from 2022.

Around one fifth of all the claims were made by people entitled to visa-free travel in Europe, including 68,000 Venezuelans and 63,000 Colombians.

The rise in applications, along with Europe welcoming in, at least temporarily, more than 4.4 million Ukrainians who have fled the war since Russia’s invasion two years ago, is overwhelming Europe’s asylum capacities. The agency said that in December, it was helping 13 countries to cope.

Open letter urges Venice Biennale art show to exclude Israel. Italy’s culture minister pushes back,"MILAN (AP) — Thousands of artists, curators and critics have signed an open letter calling on the Venice Biennale to exclude the Israeli national pavilion from this year’s contemporary art fair due to the war in Gaza, but Italy’s culture minister firmly backed Israel’s participation.

The online letter was signed by more than 17,000 people through Wednesday, which included current and past Biennale participants as well as winners of the Turner Prize, an annual prize presented to a British visual artist.

The Israeli Culture Ministry had no immediate comment.

Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano expressed solidarity with Israel in a statement Tuesday, saying it “not only has the right to express its art but has the duty to bear witness to its people precisely in a moment during which it was struck hard by merciless terrorists.”

The letter, by an ad-hoc group called “Art Not Genocide Alliance,” noted that the Biennale had discouraged South Africa’s participation due to the apartheid state from 1950-1968 and put a ban in place after the U.S. resolution suspending “exchanges with the racist regime” until apartheid ended. It also noted the Biennale’s support for Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion. Russian artists withdrew their participation in 2022.

“The Biennale has been silent about Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians,’’ the letter said. “We are appalled by this double standard.”

Signatories include the 2023 Turner Prize winner Jesse Darling, who participated in the 2019 Biennale, as well as Faisal Saleh, the director of the Palestine Museum US who said a proposed exhibit for this edition was rejected.

Israel is among 88 national participants in the 60th Venice Biennale of contemporary art, which runs from April 20-Nov. 24. The exhibition in the Israeli Pavilion is titled “Motherland” by artist Ruth Patir.

Palestinian artists are participating in collateral events, and will appear in the main show, titled “Foreigners Everywhere” curated by Adriano Pedrosa, the artistic director of Brazil’s Sao Paulo Museum of Art.

Amsterdam police say a suspect in the fatal shooting of a Dutch rapper has been arrested in Paris,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A suspect in the fatal shooting of a Dutch rapper was arrested on a European warrant at an airport in Paris early Wednesday, Amsterdam police said.

The 20-year-old man, whose identity wasn’t released, was detained at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to board a flight from Paris to French Guiana in South America, police said in a statement.

Detectives believe he fatally shot 26-year-old Danzel Silos, better known as rapper Bigidagoe, in the early hours of Sunday morning in the Dutch capital.

“The suspect is in detention and will be transferred to judicial officials in Amsterdam. Silos’ family has been informed of the arrest in Paris,” police said in a statement.

A major investigation team set up after the slaying is looking into “the background of a possible conflict between rap groups,” the statement added.

Overnight, explosions damaged homes at three locations in north and southeast Amsterdam and the word “war” was spray-painted on walls.

Germany hosts the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan for peace talks,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany sought to move forward talks on a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Wednesday, welcoming the two countries’ foreign ministers to Berlin.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock hosted her counterparts, Armenia’s Ararat Mirzoyan and Azerbaijan’s Jeyhun Bayramov, at a secluded government villa for what was billed as two days of talks.

The latest talks followed a meeting on Feb. 17 between German Chancellor OIaf Scholz, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Scholz underlined Germany’s willingness to help conclude peace talks, along with that of European Council President Charles Michel.

“We believe that Armenia and Azerbaijan now have an opportunity to achieve an enduring peace after years of painful conflict,” Baerbock, who visited both countries in November, said ahead of a three-way meeting. “What we’re seeing now are courageous steps by both countries to put the past behind and to work toward a durable peace for their people.”

Armenia and Azerbaijan have a long history of land disputes. The most recent border skirmish left at least four Armenian soldiers dead earlier in mid-February.

Azerbaijan waged a lightning military campaign last year to reclaim the Karabakh region, which Armenian separatists had ruled for three decades.

The region, which was known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and large swaths of surrounding territory came under full control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia at the end of a separatist war in 1994.

Azerbaijan regained parts of Karabakh and most of the surrounding territory in a six-week war in 2020 that ended with a Russian-brokered truce. In December 2022, Azerbaijan started blockading the road linking the region with Armenia, causing food and fuel shortages.

It then launched a blitz in September 2023 that routed the separatist forces in one day and forced them to lay down arms. More than 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled the region, leaving it nearly deserted.

With political momentum from the successful military operation, Aliyev won another term in a snap election on Feb. 7.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have pledged to work toward signing a peace treaty, but no visible progress has been made, and tensions have continued to soar amid mutual distrust.

Norway’s King Harald V warded in hospital at Malaysia’s resort island of Langkawi,"LANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) — Europe’s oldest monarch, King Harald V of Norway, remained hospitalized in Malaysia on Wednesday, in the country’s northern resort island of Langkawi, after falling ill while on vacation.

Malaysian national news agency Bernama said the 87-year-old monarch was undergoing treatment at the Sultanah Maliha Hospital in Langkawi. The report cited unnamed sources as saying he was staying at the hospital’s Royal Suite.

Norwegian TV 2 said the king’s condition is stable, citing the hospital.

The hospital declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press. Malaysia’s health ministry told the media to wait for a possible statement.

The royal palace in Oslo said on Tuesday that the king was hospitalized with an infection but did not give further details. The palace said it may send a statement out later Wednesday.

Two days before his birthday last week, Norwegian news agency NTB said that the king would be undertaking a private trip abroad together with his wife Queen Sonja, without specifying the destination or dates.

The monarch, who has been seen using crutches in recent years, has been repeatedly ill over the past months, raising concern about the head of state’s health. In January, the palace said he was on sick leave until Feb. 2 because of a respiratory infection.

In December, he was admitted to a hospital with an infection and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He also was hospitalized last August with a fever.

Still, Harald has repeatedly said he has no plans to abdicate, unlike his second cousin Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who stunned Danes when she announced her step in a New Year’s speech. Each time the king was reported ill, his 50-year-old son, Crown Prince Haakon, has taken over his duties in line with the protocol.

The palace in Oslo told NTB said there were no plans to alter a planned trip by Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit on Wednesday and Thursday to southern Norway.

On Jan. 23, Harald said that he stood by the oath he made when ascended the throne in 1991.

“I maintain what I have said all the time. It lasts for life,” he said.

Tuvalu’s new government commits to continued diplomatic ties with Taiwan instead of Beijing,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Tuvalu’s new government on Wednesday committed the tiny South Pacific island nation to continued diplomatic ties with Taiwan instead of switching to Beijing, but said it plans to renegotiate a security pact recently struck with Australia in response to China’s growing regional influence.

Prime Minister Feleti Teo and his seven Cabinet ministers were sworn into office on Wednesday following a general election last month in the strategically significant nation of 11,500 people.

Election campaign issues included whether the former British colony should switch its diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to Beijing. Some candidates proposed scrapping a treaty, yet to be ratified, that would give Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country, including China.

The new administration released a Statement of Priorities that commits it to maintaining the diplomatic relationship with Taiwan that has existed since Tuvalu became independent in 1978.

Tuvalu “intends to assess options that would strengthen and lift it to a more durable, lasting and mutually beneficial relationship,” the statement said.

In Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged Tuvalu to switch diplomatic recognition to China.

“We call on a handful of countries that still keep the so-called relationship with the Taiwan region to stand on the right side of history and make the right decision that truly serves their long-term interest,” she said.

The China issue was heightened last month when Nauru, another Pacific island nation, cut ties with Taiwan.

Tuvalu is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, a self-governed democracy that China claims as its own territory.

The new Tuvalu government said it supports the “broad principles and objectives” of the bilateral security pact with Australia that was announced last November.

But it acknowledged an “absence of transparency and consultations” behind the treaty and said it wants to renegotiate the deal with a focus on “safeguarding the integrity of the sovereignty of Tuvalu.”

Tuvalu’s low-lying atolls make it particularly vulnerable to global warming. In the treaty, Australia offered Tuvaluans a lifeline to help residents escape the rising seas and increased storms brought by climate change. Australia would initially allow up to 280 Tuvaluans to come to Australia each year.

The treaty also commits Australia to help Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, pandemics and military aggression.

In return, Australia would gain the contentious veto power that is seen as an attempt to prevent a Chinese military foothold in Tuvalu.

South Sudan blames fighting in neighboring Sudan and attacks in the Red Sea for its crisis,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan’s government on Tuesday blamed the country’s economic crisis in part on the fighting in neighboring Sudan and the instability in the Red Sea, where Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been attacking international shipping.

With most government workers not having been paid for the past of five months and the cost of living skyrocketing, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told reporters that outside factors have impacted South Sudan’s oil exports — the country’s main source of revenue.

The news conference by Lueth was meant to provide an update on South Sudan’s sluggish economy since the 2018 signing of a peace deal that ended the country’s own internal conflict.

Lueth also said that oil wells, which were water-logged by heavy floods over the past rainy season, are not yet fully operational.

The low levels of productivity have been compounded by the fact that the pipeline taking South Sudan’s crude through Sudan to its main Red Sea hub, Port Sudan, has been blocked in areas where there is fighting, he said.

But even if the crude oil were to reach Port Sudan, it would still not be possible to ship it because of the ongoing threats to shipping in the Red Sea, Leuth said.

“So, apart from low production, there are physical difficulties confronting the oil sector,” he said. “The combination of all these factors has seriously affected” South Sudan.

Neighboring Sudan plunged into chaos in mid-April when clashes erupted in the capital, Khartoum, between rival Sudanese forces — the country’s military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and a paramilitary faction known as the Rapid Support Forces, under the command of Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.

The fighting quickly spread across the African country, especially urban areas but also the restive western Darfur region, and has so far killed at least 12,000 people and sent over 8 million fleeing from their homes.

South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following decades of civil war that cost million of lives. Soon after independence South Sudan fought its own civil war from 2013 to 2018, when rivals President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar signed a power-sharing agreement and formed a coalition government.

Sweden charges a man for mapping military installations,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — A man who allegedly mapped military installations in Sweden was charged Wednesday with unauthorized possession of secret information.

“It involves a large number of facilities that are important for Sweden’s ability to defend the country in the event of war. The disclosure of information can mean but for the security of the kingdom,” Ljungqvist said in a statement.

Last year, two people had been charged with the same offense. A fourth person was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison in December.

Judge rules Prince Harry was not unfairly stripped of UK security detail after he moved to the US,"LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry was not improperly stripped of his publicly funded security detail during visits to Britain after he gave up his status as a working member of the royal family and moved to the U.S., a London judge ruled Wednesday.

Justice Peter Lane said in the High Court that the decision to provide security to Harry on a case-by-case basis was not unlawful, irrational or unjustified.

The Duke of Sussex claimed he and his family were endangered when visiting the U.K. because of hostility toward him and his wife on social media and relentless hounding by news media.

His lawyer argued that the government group that evaluated Harry’s security needs acted irrationally and failed to follow its own policies that should have required a risk analysis of the duke’s safety.

A government lawyer said Harry had been treated fairly and was still provided protection on some visits, citing a security detail that guarded him in June 2021 when he was chased by photographers after attending an event with seriously ill children at Kew Gardens in west London.

The committee that made the decision to reject his security request considered the wider impact that the “tragic death” of his mother, the late Princess Diana, had on the nation, and in making its decision gave greater weight to the “likely significant public upset were a successful attack” on her son to happen, attorney James Eadie said.

Harry, 39, the younger son of King Charles III, has broken ranks with royal family tradition in his willingness to go to court to challenge both the government and take on tabloids in his effort to hold publishers accountable for hounding him throughout his life.

The lawsuit was one of six cases Harry has brought in the High Court. Three were related to his security arrangements and three have been against tabloid publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.

In his first case to go to trial, Harry won a big victory last year against the publisher of the Daily Mirror over phone hacking allegations, winning a judgment in court and ultimately settling remaining allegations that were due to go to trial. While the settlement was undisclosed, he was to be reimbursed for all his legal fees and was due to receive an interim payment of 400,000 pounds ($505,000).

He recently withdrew a libel case against the Daily Mail over an article that said he tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security. Harry dropped the case after a judge ruled he was more likely to lose at trial because the publisher could show that statements issued on his behalf were misleading and that the February 2022 article reflected an “honest opinion” and wasn’t libelous.

Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London’s police force to guard him when he comes to town. A judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn’t be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.”",Resume172,[],2024-02-28 11:18:39,"['stripped', 'uk', 'rules', 'unfairly', 'trial', 'court', 'family', 'harry', 'visits', 'judge', 'decision', 'prince', 'moved', 'security', 'lawyer', 'case']",ap_news_articles
The UK is stepping up lawmakers’ security as tensions flare over the Israel-Hamas war,"LONDON (AP) — The British government said Wednesday that it is stepping up security for lawmakers after politicians reported threats and intimidation connected to the Israel-Hamas war.

The Home Office said a 31 million-pound ($40 million) fund will give every lawmaker a “dedicated named police contact” and provide money for those facing threats to pay for private security protection.

The government said some of the money will go more broadly to protecting Britain’s “democratic processes from intimidation, disruption or subversion” ahead of a general election later this year. The fund includes money for extra police patrols in areas where tensions are high.

The announcement got a mixed reception. Some legislators said the heightened security measures didn’t address the underlying reasons why politics has grown more toxic. Anti-war activists claimed the government was trying to stifle protest and lumping peaceful demonstrators in with violent extremists.

British lawmakers have a tradition of meeting regularly with constituents in their local communities, but security has been tightened after several attacks in the last decade. In 2016, Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, and Conservative David Amess was murdered in 2021 by an attacker inspired by the Islamic State group.

In 2017 an Islamic State-inspired extremist killed four people with a vehicle on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer to death at the gates of Parliament. The following year a neo-Nazi pleaded guilty to plotting to kill a Labour lawmaker.

Divisions over the conflict in Gaza have convulsed British politics, with some lawmakers saying they fear for their safety after receiving threats over their positions on the war. Reports of both antisemitic and anti-Muslim abuse in Britain have soared since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which triggered Israel’s invasion of Gaza.

A debate last week in the House of Commons on whether to call for a cease-fire descended into chaos amid allegations the speaker of the house had bent parliamentary rules in response to pressure from pro-Palestinian activists.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators protested at the house of a Conservative lawmaker earlier this month, while environmental activists have targeted Sunak’s family home in northern England.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suspended Conservative lawmaker Lee Anderson for saying Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim, was controlled by Islamists and had allowed them to take charge of the city.

Conservative lawmaker Mike Freer — who has announced he is is stepping down because of abuse and death threats linked to his support for Israel — said the money announced Wednesday was only “dealing with the symptom” rather than “going to the root cause” of why people feel emboldened to attack politicians.

“Security is welcome,” Freer told Times Radio. “But frankly, unless you get to the root cause, then you’re just going to have a ring of steel around MPs. And our whole style of democracy changes.”

Home Secretary James Cleverly called on pro-Palestinian demonstrators to halt the mass protests that have drawn hundreds of thousands of people to central London almost weekly to call for a cease-fire in a conflict that has killed close to 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Israel says Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and abducted roughly 250, in the Oct. 7 attack.

The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, though there have dozens of arrests over signs and chants allegedly supporting Hamas, a banned organization in Britain. Jewish organizations and many lawmakers say the mass marches have created an intimidating atmosphere for Jewish Londoners — though members of the Jewish community have been among those on pro-cease-fire marches.

“I genuinely don’t know what these regular protests are seeking to achieve,” Cleverly told the Times of London in an interview published Wednesday. “They have made their position clear, we recognize that there are many people in the U.K. that hold that position. We respect that, but the U.K. government’s position is a disagreement with that for very practical, well thought-out reasons.”

The government says it supports an immediate “humanitarian pause” in the fighting but says a permanent cease-fire can only happen if Hamas frees all Israeli hostages and relinquishes control of Gaza.

Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which has organized many protests, said Cleverly’s comments showed the government did not understand the role of protest “as an important part of the democratic process.”

“They regard it as a hindrance, something that should be suppressed,” Jamal said.",Resume173,"['Lawless Is An Associated Press Reporter Covering U.K. Politics', 'More.

"Zuckerberg meets LG, Samsung chiefs in Seoul as Meta ramps up AI ambitions","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed cooperation on extended reality devices with LG Electronics executives on Wednesday as part of his visit to South Korea that highlights Meta’s ambitions in artificial intelligence.

South Korea is the second leg of Zuckerberg’s three-nation Asian tour that observers say is meant to discuss partnerships with tech powerhouses and forge good relations with business and government leaders in the region. He already visited Japan and will travel to India later this week.

On Wednesday, Zuckerberg met LG Electronics CEO William Cho for two hours to talk about business strategies for extended reality — known as XR — device development, LG said in a statement.

While experiencing Meta’s latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, Cho “expressed a keen interest in Meta’s advanced technology demonstrations, notably focusing on Meta’s large language models and its potential for on-device AI integration,” the LG statement said.

LG is ramping up its strategic collaboration with Meta, aiming to expedite its XR ventures, it said. XR includes augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality and other related technologies.

Later Wednesday, Zuckerberg met Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong, according to local media. He is scheduled to meet South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday.

“Meta already collaborated with high-end sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to launch smart glasses last year. Just like this, Meta could possibly want to introduce their XR technology to a worldwide customer base of a global consumer electronics maker like LG,” said Kim Yang Paeng, a technology analyst at the Korea Institute of Economics and Technology.

Kim said Zuckerberg will also likely talk with Samsung about producing Meta-exclusive chips to ease its reliance on the AI chip market-dominant NVIDIA.

Zuckerberg’s visit to Asia comes as Meta ramps up its efforts in artificial intelligence amid a race involving technology firms OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. In a Instagram reel in January, Zuckerberg said that it was Meta’s “long term vision to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit.”

Meta is building massive compute infrastructure — equivalent to 600k NVIDIA H100 GPUs’ worth — to support its artificial intelligence plans as it begins training its Llama 3 generative AI model, he said in the reel. Generative AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta’s Llama 3 are artificial intelligence systems that can generate content based on user prompts.

Lee Tae-kyu, an expert at the Korea Economic Research Institute, said Meta would think cooperation with Samsung and LG is important as they are top-level tech companies outside the United States. Samsung and LG, on the other hand, would also highly value partnerships with Meta, whose products target customers around the world.

During his visit to Tokyo, Zuckerberg met Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and later told reporters: “We had a good productive conversation about AI and the future of technology, and I am really excited for the work that is happening here in Japan.”

He was in Japan with his family for a trip that mixed business with pleasure. He went skiing with his family, visited a McDonald’s outlet and learned how swords are made at a swordsmiths near Tokyo.

During his visit to India, he will attend a wedding ceremony for the son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, head of the oil and technology conglomerate Reliance Industries.

Pope Francis had diagnostic tests in a Rome hospital after his weekly audience,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis, who recently had the flu, was brought to a hospital in Rome for diagnostic testing after the papal audience Wednesday, the Vatican said, without giving further details.

The pope arrived at the Gemelli Hospital on Tiber Island in a small white Fiat 500, leaving again under escort in the same car after a short visit.

Earlier in the day, the 86-year-old pope was pushed in a wheelchair into the audience hall at the Vatican, appearing weary as he dropped heavily into his seat. In recent weeks he has walked the short distance to his chair, but he has been struggling with mild flu symptoms the past week.

The pope also canceled appointments Saturday and Monday due to the flu, but appeared as usual for the Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square.

Last week, Francis coughed repeatedly as he presided over Ash Wednesday services at a Roman church, and opted not to participate in the traditional procession that inaugurates the church’s Lenten season.

This time of year in 2020, just as the coronavirus pandemic was starting to hit Italy, Francis also suffered a bad cold that forced him to cancel several days of official audiences and his participation in the Vatican’s annual spiritual retreat. The Vatican had already scrubbed the retreat for this year in favor of personal spiritual exercises

The Argentine pope had part of one lung removed as a young man because of a respiratory infection, and in 2021 had a chunk of his colon removed because of an intestinal inflammation. He has been using a wheelchair and cane since last year because of strained knee ligaments and a small knee fracture that have made walking and standing difficult.

The Pope used his brief words at the end of Wednesday’s audience to mark the 25th anniversary of the ratification of the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention, expressing his “closeness to the numerous victims of these insidious devices that remind us of the dramatic cruelty of war.”

He also appealed for peace in the Middle East, Ukraine and prayed for the victims of attacks in Burkina Faso and Haiti.

At the end of the audience, the pope spent about an hour greeting the faithful from his wheelchair, stopping to talk, bless babies and exchange gifts.",Resume175,[],2024-02-28 10:47:16,"['vatican', 'hospital', 'short', 'tests', 'diagnostic', 'rome', 'weekly', 'spiritual', 'pope', 'audience', 'flu', 'victims', 'francis', 'small', 'wheelchair']",ap_news_articles
A bill to make abortion a constitutional right goes to a vote in the French Senate,"PARIS (AP) — France’s Senate is to vote on Wednesday on a bill meant to enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion in the constitution, a measure promised by President Emmanuel Macron following a rollback on rulings in the United States.

Wednesday’s vote comes after the lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January.

A majority of senators appear to be in favor of the constitutional change, but some conservatives have criticized its wording, casting doubt over the outcome of the vote.

Macron’s government wants Article 34 of the constitution amended to specify that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.”

If the Senate adopts the same version of the bill as the National Assembly, the constitutional change will require definitive approval by a three-fifths majority of a joint session of parliament, traditionally held at the Palace of Versailles.

If the Senate amends the proposal or reject it, the bill must return to the National Assembly for further debate.

None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament is questioning the right to abortion, which was decriminalized in 1975.

The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it.

“Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says.

In Poland, a controversial tightening of the already restrictive abortion law led to protests in the country last year The Polish constitutional court ruled in 2020 that women could no longer terminate pregnancies in cases of severe fetal deformities, including Down Syndrome.",Resume176,[],2024-02-28 10:00:17,"['national', 'french', 'senate', 'united', 'bill', 'constitutional', 'goes', 'vote', 'abortion', 'right', 'women', 'assembly']",ap_news_articles
"Police will be allowed to march in Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras, but not in uniform","MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras organizers agreed Wednesday to relax their ban on police marching in their annual parade with a compromise condition that officers do not wear uniforms.

The decision comes a day after Australian police found the bodies of a couple allegedly shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend, who happened to be a police officer, after he admitted to killing them and hiding their bodies under rocks and debris on a rural property.

On Monday, the board of one of the world’s largest gay pride celebrations asked police not to attend after Senior Constable Beau Lamarre-Condon, 28, was charged with murder in the shooting of his ex-boyfriend and former television reporter Jesse Baird, 26; and Baird’s partner, flight attendant Luke Davies, 29. The couple was killed Feb. 19 in Baird’s home in Sydney. Lamarre-Condon, who briefly dated Baird until late 2023, was arrested Friday.

New South Wales Police Force Commissioner Karen Webb had protested against police being excluded from the March 2 parade, arguing that the homicide was an alleged “crime of passion” rather than the result of “gay hate.”

Webb and the board announced the compromise Wednesday against a background of public anger.

“Police have agreed not to march in uniform, in consideration of current sensitivities,” Webb said in a statement. “I am delighted that our LGBTQIA+ officers, as well as our other police who are allies and supporters, will be allowed to march this year as they have done for the past 20 years.”

The Mardi Gras board added in their statement that police would participate in a “reduced capacity to the originally-planned NSW Police float.” The board did not elaborate on that reduction.

Lamarre-Condon has marched with the police contingent in past parades.

Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras began in 1978 as a street protest against discrimination that was brutally broken up by police. Police participation since then has always been divisive, but uniformed police officers have been marching since 1998 as a gesture of respect and support.

Rights campaigner Charlie Murphy described police marching Saturday as “salt on open wounds.”

Australian Federal Police officers have decided not to march, abandoning plans to join their New South Wales state police counterparts.

Swisscom confirms talks to buy Vodafone’s Italian unit for 8B euros,"GENEVA (AP) — Telecoms operator Swisscom confirmed Wednesday it’s in talks with Vodafone Group toward a possible purchase of its Italian subsidiary for 8 billion euros ($8.65 billion).

The Swiss company, which is majority owned by the Swiss government, said in a statement it’s in “advanced exclusive negotiations” to buy all of Vodafone Italia and merge it with Swisscom’s Italian subsidiary, Fastweb.

Swisscom says it expects the purchase, if concluded, would add value and cash flow to the Swiss company and help improve its dividend policy.

Strikes halt trains and ferries in Greece a year after country’s worst rail disaster that killed 57,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Widespread strikes in Greece halted trains, ferries and much of the capital’s public transport on Wednesday in protests timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the country’s deadliest rail crash, which killed 57 people.

The train disaster on the night of Feb. 28, 2023 shocked the country. Many of the victims were university students heading back to class after a public holiday when their passenger train slammed into an oncoming cargo train after the two were accidentally put onto the same track heading in opposite directions.

Wednesday’s strike disrupted public transport in the capital, Athens, and left ferries tied up in ports as unions pressed demands to further dismantle wage controls imposed during Greece’s near decade-long financial crisis. Flights were unaffected after a court ruled that participation in the walk-out by air traffic controllers was illegal. Farmers and university students have also been staging anti-government protests in recent weeks.

At the scene of the rail crash in Tempi, central Greece, relatives of the victims gathered for a memorial service as churches across the country tolled their bells 57 times Wednesday morning to honor the dead.

“This is a pain that will never end, a wound that will never heal,” said Panos Routsi, whose 22-year-old son, Denis, was killed.

He said he supported a petition that has gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures to strip parliamentary immunity from lawmakers responsible for rail safety when the collision occurred.

“What I want is for them all to be (punished), all those responsible wherever they are hiding, hiding behind immunity,” he said.

Flowers and candles were placed at the rail crash site, along with a banner reading: “Unpunished crime in Tempi, the souls demand justice.”

“I thought I was putting my children onto the safest form of transport and they were driven to their deaths,” said Nikos Plakias, who lost his 19-year-old twin daughters and one niece in the crash. Those responsible “knew the problems and they said nothing.”

In the capital, protesters gathered outside Parliament chanting “murderers, murderers,” while thousands of demonstrators, some holding up flares and red helium-filled balloons, gathered outside the headquarters of the country’s rail operator. Some spray-painted the slogan “Our Lives” in front of a riot police cordon backed with a water cannon truck.

The rallies halted traffic in much of the capital. Scuffles broke out between police and protesters in the capital and in similar protests in Thessaloniki, the country’s second-largest city, where riot police fired tear gas and stun grenades to repel demonstrators throwing paint, stones and Molotov cocktails.

Protest organizers disputed government assurances that rail safety had been comprehensively overhauled in the past 12 months.

In a statement marking the anniversary of the disaster, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said an ongoing judicial investigation into the crash has the government’s full support and cooperation.

“On this sad anniversary we bow our heads in memory of the 57 innocent people we lost and the ordeal of those wounded,” he said. “Our thoughts are with families, who have every right to turn their pain into protest.”

Stock market today: Wall Street edges back from its records as bitcoin bounces higher again,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are slipping Wednesday and drifting a bit lower from their all-time highs.

The S&P 500 was down 0.3% in early trading, continuing a quiet and listless run since it set a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 216 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:40 a.m. Eastern time , and the Nasdaq composite was 0.4% lower a day after pulling within 0.1% of its record set in 2021.

Treasury yields were also holding relatively steady in the bond market after a report said the U.S. economy likely grew a touch slower at the end of 2023 than earlier estimated. The growth was nevertheless still solid, as the economy continues to defy expectations of a recession despite high interest rates meant to bring down inflation.

Nvidia was one of the heaviest weights on the market, dipping 1.2%. It’s been on a breathtaking run as it rides Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, which has raised criticism that its price has gone too far, too fast.

Bumble sank 4.4% after it reported weaker results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The dating and friend-making app company, which recently revamped its leadership team, also gave a forecast for revenue this upcoming year that fell short of analysts’.

Boston Beer, the company behind Samuel Adams, slid 13.2% after reporting a larger loss than analysts expected. It was hurt by declines for its Truly seltzer.

Urban Outfitters dropped 8.4% after the retailer reported weaker results than expected. The company, which also runs Anthropologie stores, said sales are continuing to weaken at its Urban Outfitters locations.

Helping to limit the market’s losses was eBay, which rose 7.5% after reporting stronger results than analysts expected. Agilent Technologies was another strong force pushing upward on the S&P 500, rising 3.9% after beating forecasts for both profit and revenue.

Coinbase gained 3.7% to continue its strong run as bitcoin’s price keeps rallying. New exchange-traded funds that make investing in bitcoin easier have raised interest in the cryptocurrency, and its price topped $60,000 for the first time since 2021. It’s still below its record of nearly $69,000.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin fund alone has quickly grown to $7 billion in assets.

Beyond Meat soared 38% even though it reported much weaker results for the latest quarter than expected. Its revenue was slightly better than forecast, falling less than expected, and it said its profitability will likely increase through 2024.

Axon Enterprise, the company that makes Tasers, body cameras and other equipment, also turned in a better-than-expected profit report, and its stock gained 2.2%. It’s also forecasting growth in revenue of up to 24% this year.

In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia and Europe.

Stocks fell 1.9% in Shanghai and 1.5% in Hong Kong. China’s largest private property developer, Country Garden, said Wednesday it’s facing a liquidation petition after failing to repay a term loan facility worth 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars ($204.5 million). The first hearing in the case is scheduled for May 17.

The move comes after China Evergrande, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, was ordered to undergo liquidation following a failed effort to restructure $300 billion in late January.

"Hong Kong lifts curbs on property market, to spend more on tourism","HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s government has lifted curbs on property deals after home prices fell to a seven-year low, adding to the Chinese territory’s woes.

Finance minister Paul Chan announced the move in a speech presenting the territory’s budget, which also raised spending on tourism promotion. He said all curbs, such as extra taxes, imposed earlier to cool the property market would be lifted with immediate effect.

Home prices have fallen for nine consecutive months and share prices have languished as a tightening of freedoms in the former British colony has rattled investors. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s tourism has not fully rebounded after it reopened to foreign travelers following the COVID-19 pandemic. China’s slowing economy has also impacted Hong Kong’s recovery.

Chan said the limits on property transactions were “no longer necessary amid the current economic and market conditions.”

The government lifted a 15% stamp duty imposed on non-permanent residents who buy property in Hong Kong and a 15% stamp duty charged on purchases of a second property.

Homeowners also no longer must pay a separate duty on sales of homes purchased less than two years before.

Chan said more measures might be taken to ease property lending.

“We consider that there is now room to make further adjustments to the relevant measures and other supervisory policies pertinent to property lending where appropriate, under the premise of maintaining the stability of the banking system,” Chan said.

Last year, the city reduced by half taxes charged on home purchases by non-permanent resident homebuyers and those buying additional properties.

Shares of property developers in Hong Kong jumped after the scrapping of cooling measures was announced. Henderson Land’s shares rose 4.1%, while New World Development’s soared 5.9%. Sun Hung Kai Properties jumped 4.1%.

As an additional tourist attraction, Chan said the city will revamp its light show on scenic Victoria Harbor and stage monthly pyrotechnic and drone shows over the waterfront.

Another $100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.8 million) will go to promoting big events in the city, highlighting activities like hiking and cycling and creating a new tourism brand to “soft-sell” Hong Kong, he said.

The city also will collaborate with mainland Chinese cities to boost tourism in the Greater Bay Area surrounding Hong Kong.

Mainland Chinese tourists are the majority of visitors to Hong Kong. Over the Lunar New Year holidays, Hong Kong recorded nearly 1.44 million visitors to the city, nearly 90% of them from the mainland.

Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to Beijing in 1997, with an agreement that the territory would be allowed to keep many of its Western style freedoms, such as a separate legal system and freedom of the press, for a half century. However many of those civil liberties have been curtailed with the enforcement of national security legislation following a wave of mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.",Resume181,[],2024-02-28 07:12:10,"['kongs', 'market', 'measures', 'million', 'lifts', 'lifted', 'prices', 'tourism', 'property', 'hong', 'curbs', 'kong', 'spend', 'city']",ap_news_articles
"A quarter of Gaza’s population is one step from famine and aid trucks are looted, UN says","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — At least one quarter of Gaza’s population – 576,000 people – are one step away from famine and virtually the entire population desperately needs food resulting in some aid trucks being shot at, looted and overwhelmed by hungry people, top U.N. officials said Tuesday.

The officials from the U.N. humanitarian office and the U.N.’s food and agriculture organizations painted a dire picture of all 2.3 million people in Gaza facing crisis levels of food insecurity or worse, and civil order breaking down especially in the north where food and other humanitarian supplies are scarce.

And as grim as the picture is today, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Ramesh Ramasingham told the U.N. Security Council that “there is every possibility for further deterioration.”

He said that in addition to a quarter of Gaza’s population close to famine, 1 in 6 children under the age of two in northern Gaza are suffering from “acute malnutrition and wasting,” where the body becomes emaciated.

Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said that is “the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world.” And he warned that “If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza” -- the initial target of Israel’s military offensive following Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people and led to about 250 being taken captive.

In the latest example of the breakdown of civil order, Skau said WFP resumed deliveries to northern Gaza for the first time in three weeks on Feb. 18, and hoped to send 10 trucks a day for seven days to address immediate food needs and provide some reassurance to people that sufficient food would be arriving.

But on both Feb. 18 and Feb. 19, he said, WFP convoys faced delays at checkpoints, gunfire and other violence and the looting of food.

“At their destination, they were overwhelmed by desperately hungry people,” he said.

Skau said “the breakdown in civil order, driven by sheer desperation, is preventing the safe distribution of aid – and we have a duty to protect our staff.”

As a result, he said, WFP has suspended aid deliveries to the north until conditions are in place to ensure the security of its staff and the people receiving assistance.

Maurizio Martina, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s deputy director general, described the horrific state of farmland, greenhouses, bakeries and irrigation systems that are essential to produce, process and distribute food.

Since Oct. 9 – two days after the Hamas attacks – “the government of Israel’s reinforced blockade has included stopping or restricting food, electricity and fuel supplies, as well as commercial goods,” he said.

This has affected the entire food supply chain in different ways, Martina said.

As examples, he said, severe restrictions on fuel shipments are crippling water supplies and the functioning of desalination plants, with the water supply at only 7% of pre-October levels. Fuel shortages have also crippled the production and delivery of food and electricity, and seriously hampered the ability of bakeries to produce bread, he said.

Martina said the collapse of agricultural production in the north is already happening and in the most likely scenario will be complete by May. And as of Feb. 15, over 46% of all crop land in Gaza was assessed to be damaged, he said.

The FAO official presented more alarming figures from Israel’s offensive -- a high number of animal shelters and sheep and dairy farms destroyed, over one-quarter of water wells destroyed, and 339 hectares of greenhouses destroyed. And he said the war has also heavily impacted the harvest of olives and citrus fruits, a key Palestinian money earner.

As for animals, Martina said, many livestock owners report substantial losses, all poultry have likely been slaughtered, and as many as 65% of calves and 70% of beef cattle are assumed to have died.

Israel’s deputy U.N. ambassador Brett Miller told the council that while fighting Hamas it is doing “all it can to care for civilians,” and is working constantly to ensure the entry of humanitarian aid from numerous countries and U.N. agencies.

Since the Oct. 7 attacks, he said, Israel has facilitated the delivery of 254,000 tons of humanitarian aid including 165,000 tons of food. “There is absolutely no limit – and I repeat there is no limit – to the amount of humanitarian aid that can be sent to the civilian population of Gaza,” he said.

Miller countered that 20 bakeries throughout Gaza are producing over 2 million pita breads a day.

He accused the U.N. of refusing to deliver aid to northern Gaza, and some U.N. officials of trying to shift the blame to Israel.

In recent days, Miller said, 508 trucks have been waiting to cross into Gaza with Israeli approval. “So where is the U.N. and its aid agencies? How can it be that Israel is libelously held responsible for a situation that is clearly the U.N.’s fault?” he asked.

U.N. humanitarian coordinator Ramasingham, WFP’s Skau and FAO’s Martina all had a similar response: The first step to eliminating the looming threat of famine is a ceasefire so humanitarian workers can enter Gaza.

“If nothing is done, we fear widespread famine in Gaza is almost inevitable,” Ramasingham said, and the Palestinian death toll which has reached almost 30,000 “will have many more victims.” That figure from the Gaza Health Ministry doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants, though the U.N. says the majority are women and children.",Resume182,[],2024-02-28 02:39:58,"['humanitarian', 'wfp', 'gaza', 'trucks', 'aid', 'northern', 'feb', 'food', 'martina', 'quarter', 'gazas', 'looted', 'population', 'famine', 'step']",ap_news_articles

At least 9 killed and 6 injured in police raids in Rio de Janeiro favelas,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A police raid Tuesday morning in several Rio de Janeiro’s sprawling, low-income neighborhoods left at least nine dead and six injured, police said in a statement.

The raids targeted areas controlled by the Red Command drug trafficking group and took place in several communities in the city’s north, including Cidade de Deus, and the Alemao and Penha complexes of favelas.

Local residents took to social media to share videos and photos of intense gunfire. Thousands of children were forced to stay home, with public transport and schools shut while the operation was ongoing.

TV broadcaster Globo News showed images of barricades — made of rubber tires, furniture, cars — sometimes set on fire by criminals in an effort to slow down police.

According to Fogo Cruzado, a nonprofit organization that provides real-time reporting of gun violence in Brazil, shots in the Alemao complex were still being reported mid-afternoon.

"UConn’s Aaliyah Edwards signs NIL deal in Canada, but can’t talk about it in the US","STORRS, Conn. (AP) — UConn forward Aaliyah Edwards signed a big name, image and likeness contract this week with adidas Canada, but wasn’t allowed to speak with reporters in Connecticut about it on Tuesday, for fear that promoting the deal might jeopardize her student visa.

Under current United States law, Edwards, who is from Kingston, Ontario, and other international students can only make money in this country with passive NIL deals. She gets a little something, for example, if someone buys a jersey with her name on it at the campus bookstore.

But unlike her teammate Paige Bueckers, who is estimated to be worth more than half a million dollars in the NIL world, Edwards can’t actively participate in endorsements in the United States.

Her financial security no doubt made it a bit easier for Bueckers to decide she will come back to UConn for another season rather than enter this year’s WNBA draft.

Edwards and fellow international player Nika Muhl (Croatia) also have eligibility remaining, but neither of them have announced whether they plan to return or turn pro.

Edwards, who is averaging more than 19 points and 10 rebounds a game for the Huskies (24-5, 16-0 Big East), said Tuesday that her decision will be based on basketball and achieving the goals she has for herself and the team. But she acknowledged that money is also a factor.

“Maybe a little bit,” she said. “It’s a little influence. But it’s really about the team.”

Adidas did not release terms of Edwards NIL deal, but a spokeswoman told The Associated Press Tuesday that the company is “being respectful of the NIL rules and Aaliyah will only participate in Canada during her NIL adidas Canada deal.”

Muhl said she’s pretty much made a decision on whether to return to UConn and is just waiting for the right time to make an announcement.

The senior guard said because she never had NIL money and it wasn’t part of the reason she chose to play at UConn, it won’t be a factor in her decision to leave or stay.

“The legacy here, the things that you learn are so much more than the money you can get,” she said. “I feel that is going to translate into life later ... what you learned about perseverance, resilience, hard work, dedication, discipline. And you’re going to make money later on in life just by having that experience here.”

Their coach, Geno Auriemma, said he would love to see Congress carve out an exception to student visa rules that would allow international students to at least make grocery money, whether or not they are athletes.

But he said he understands the government can’t just open up work visas to anyone who wants one.

“If they can find a way to get these people treated the same as every other student athlete, great,” he said.

The issue has gotten the attention of Connecticut’s two U.S. senators, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, who have both been pushing for better compensation for college athletes.

Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Oregon Republican Pete Ricketts introduced legislation last October that would create a sub-category within the F-1 visa narrowly tailored to international student-athletes who want to pursue NIL opportunities. Blumenthal said Tuesday he doesn’t have a timetable for passage, but hopes to attach the legislation to an upcoming appropriations bill and get it approved this year.

“These restrictions are totally outdated as applied to NIL, and obviously hugely unfair,” he said.

Services prepare to brief Secretary Austin on a plan to get Ospreys flying again,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The military services will take a key step toward getting the V-22 Osprey fleet back in the air as they lay out their plans Friday to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for addressing safety concerns stemming from a fatal crash in Japan, three defense officials said.

The U.S. fleet of about 400 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft has been grounded for 83 days following the crash of a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22B on Nov. 29 in Japan that killed eight service members. It’s unclear how quickly Austin would make any decision on the matter.

The Air Force has said it knows what failed in the Osprey but still does not know why it failed. In the months since, the services have worked on a plan to mitigate the known material failure through additional safety checks and also by establishing a new, more conservative approach to how the Osprey is operated to safely work around the known issue, a fourth official, a senior defense official familiar with the V-22 program, said.

Japan is the only international partner in the Osprey program and also grounded its fleet of 14 V-22s after the November crash. A return to flight is a sensitive topic in the country, where public opinion on the Osprey is mixed. One of the defense officials said none of the U.S. Ospreys would return to flight until Japan has had an opportunity to weigh in on the military’s plan.

After that, each service would decide on its own return to flight. Not all services would need to put their Ospreys back into operation simultaneously.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the Osprey decision process.

The V-22 Osprey can take of and land like a helicopter, but then tilt its engines and rotor blades to fly like an airplane. The combination has enabled the services to travel vast distances faster during military operations and land in locations that are more difficult for normal aircraft.

The military-wide grounding has left the deepest impact on the U.S. Marine Corps, which relies on more than 300 MV-22 Ospreys to conduct a major part of its aviation mission. Air Force Special Operations Command has about 50 CV-22B Ospreys. The Navy is planning on replacing its C-2 Greyhounds, which transport passengers to aircraft carriers, with more than two dozen CMV-22 Ospreys.

The presidential fleet also uses a limited number of Ospreys to ferry White House staff, security personnel and reporters. Those have also been grounded since Dec. 6.

A small number of Marine Corps MV-22s in Djibouti have had an exemption to the grounding since Jan. 17 due to mission needs and have flown since then without incident.

The extraordinary decision in December to ground the aircraft military-wide reflected questions about the safety of the platform. Just before the November incident in Japan, an Osprey crash in August killed three Marines.

The first Ospreys only became operational in 2007 after decades of testing. But more than 50 troops have died either flight testing them or conducting training flights over the program’s lifespan.

The loss of the Osprey has had an operational impact, but a return to flight won’t be immediate and will still be higher risk due to the amount of time those crews have not been flying.

Flight safety is dependent on pilots maintaining currency on an aircraft — meaning that they are flying regularly enough to be proficient in all types of flying, such as night missions, close formation flying and refueling. The senior defense official said it will take at least 30 days to get crews flying once the grounding is lifted.

The services have also had to ensure the aircraft are ready. Both the Air Force and Marine Corps have been running the Osprey’s engines; the Marines have been conducting ground movements to keep the aircraft working.",Resume186,[],2024-02-27 21:39:31,"['brief', 'prepare', 'aircraft', 'flying', 'flight', 'defense', 'safety', 'ospreys', 'japan', 'secretary', 'austin', 'return', 'air', 'services', 'plan', 'osprey']",ap_news_articles
New York Philharmonic’s outgoing director Jaap van Zweden will lead a French radio orchestra,"Outgoing New York Philharmonic music director Jaap van Zweden will assume the same role with Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France starting with the 2026-27 season.

He will succeed Mikko Franck, who has been music director since 2015-16.

The 63-year-old van Zweden began in New York in September 2018 and his six-season tenure that ends this season is the shortest since Pierre Boulez succeeded Leonard Bernstein and led the orchestra from 1971-77.

"A Canadian mass killer died from a cocaine overdose, a pathologist says","SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) — A man who killed 11 people and injured 17 others died from a cocaine overdose after he was taken into police custody, a pathologist told a coroner’s inquest in Canada on Tuesday.

Myles Sanderson, 32, had been on the run for several days in the province of Saskatchewan when police caught up to him on Sept. 7, 2022.

He went into medical distress during his arrest and was pronounced dead in a hospital. Officials hadn’t released the details until now.

“There was so much cocaine there,” said forensic pathologist Dr. Shaun Ladham, describing the amount of the drug found in Sanderson’s body.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police dashboard camera video played at the inquest shows Sanderson’s arrest after a high-speed chase.

He began to convulse and was given naloxone, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses.

Three days before he was captured, Sanderson went from home to home on the James Smith Cree Nation and in the nearby village of Weldon, kicking in doors and attacking people.

The stabbing rampage raised questions of why Sanderson — an ex-convict with 59 convictions and a long history of violence — was out on the streets in the first place.

Earlier Tuesday, jurors heard Sanderson ask Mounties during his arrest how many he had killed.

“How many bodies did I get?” he says in the dashboard video.

Sgt. Ken Kane, a detective with Saskatoon police, described the video for jurors, saying Sanderson expressed shock that “nobody even shot at me, man.”

“You should have shot me,” Sanderson says repeatedly to officers in the video.

The inquest previously heard how Sanderson was able to evade capture for three days and seven hours after the killings.

A call that came in to police from a woman who said Sanderson had broken into her home and stolen her truck set off a rapid search throughout the area.

A separate inquest into the massacre was held last month, which examined each of the killings and issued more than two dozen recommendations.

The inquest into Sanderson’s death, which is scheduled for a week in Saskatoon, is required under legislation because he died in police custody.

It is to establish when and where Sanderson died and the cause of his death. The six-person jury may also provide recommendations.",Resume188,[],2024-02-27 20:58:48,"['inquest', 'overdose', 'saskatoon', 'shot', 'killer', 'pathologist', 'sandersons', 'days', 'sanderson', 'cocaine', 'video', 'went', 'canadian', 'died', 'arrest', 'mass']",ap_news_articles

Watch as the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on Ukraine on Friday, 23 February, ahead of the second anniversary of the Russian invasion.

The two-year anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion comes as the US announced its largest single package of sanctions against Moscow.

Sanctions and export controls have been announced to slow Russia down, ""making it harder for them to fight their war of choice,"" Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said.

US officials said more than 500 targets will be sanctioned in the latest package including from Russia's military industrial complex and companies in third countries that facilitate the Kremlin’s access to goods it wants.

Additionally, EU member states approved a 13th package of Ukraine-related sanctions against Moscow on Wednesday, banning nearly 200 entities and individuals accused of helping Russia procure weapons or of involvement in kidnapping Ukrainian children.

Moscow denies any kidnapping has taken place.

In response to the latest round of sanctions by the bloc, Moscow banned more EU officials and politicians from Russia.

The Russian foreign ministry said: ""The European Union is continuing its fruitless attempts to put pressure on Russia through unilateral restrictive measures.""",Resume189,[],2024-02-23 18:23:06+00:00,"['russian', 'meets', 'invading', 'sign', 'sanctions', 'verifyerrors', 'russia', 'officials', 'anniversary', 'watch', 'ukraine', 'email', 'breaking', 'package', 'ahead', 'second', 'valid']",the_independent_articles

The World Food Program has suspended what it described as “life-saving” aid deliveries into northern Gaza over safety concerns.

The United Nations agency said in a statement on Tuesday that the decision had “not been taken lightly,” but added that the pause would continue “until conditions are in place that allow for safe distributions.”

“Gaza is hanging by a thread and WFP must be enabled to reverse the path towards famine for thousands of desperately hungry people,” the agency said.

The suspension came despite warnings from the agency that people in Gaza are already dying from hunger-related causes, and that its teams on the ground were witnessing “unprecedented levels of desperation.”

“Food and safe water have become incredibly scarce and diseases are rife, compromising women and children’s nutrition and immunity and resulting in a surge of acute malnutrition. People are already dying from hunger-related causes,” the WFP said in its statement.

Israel’s war in Gaza, which was launched in response to a Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people, has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in the beleaguered territory.

The UN has warned that more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing “catastrophic hunger,” and the risk of famine increases every day. That risk has been increased by the decision by Israel to block a significant number of aid trucks from entering Gaza. The UN said that 80 per cent of aid deliveries destined for northern Gaza were blocked by the Israeli army in January.

The WFP had already suspended its aid deliveries for three weeks prior to Tuesday’s decision due to an Israeli strike on a UNWRA truck. When it attempted to resume deliveries to northern Gaza again, it said the convoy was “surrounded by crowds of hungry people,” and staff were forced to fend off attempts to climb aboard the trucks. When it reached Gaza City it came under gunfire.

A second convoy faced “complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” the WFP said. It added that several trucks were looted and a truck driver was beaten.

Even before the suspension of aid deliveries, northern Gaza was facing an acute food crisis. In a report released a day before the announcement, the WFP and UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, found that around 15 per cent of children under 2 years of age in the north were “acutely malnourished.”

“Of these, almost 3 per cent suffer from severe wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, which puts young children at highest risk of medical complications and death unless they receive urgent treatment,” the report noted.

“The Gaza Strip is poised to witness an explosion in preventable child deaths which would compound the already unbearable level of child deaths in Gaza,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, Ted Chaiban.

“We’ve been warning for weeks that the Gaza Strip is on the brink of a nutrition crisis. If the conflict doesn’t end now, children’s nutrition will continue to plummet, leading to preventable deaths or health issues which will affect the children of Gaza for the rest of their lives and have potential intergenerational consequences.”

More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s offensive in the densely populated territory, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.",Resume191,[],2024-02-20 23:51:33+00:00,"['wfp', 'gaza', 'trucks', 'sign', 'deliveries', 'aid', 'verifyerrors', 'northern', 'suspends', 'food', 'agency', 'world', 'lifesaving', 'program', 'security', 'concerns', 'children']",the_independent_articles

To mark the second anniversary of the war in Ukraine breaking out, The Independent is bringing together a panel of experts who have been at the forefront of the coverage of the conflict.

Two years have passed since Russia invaded its European neighbour and the war has left Ukraine and its people in a state of utter devastation.

Our panel will be looking back at some of the key moments from the past two years, as well as looking ahead to what is likely to happen next and if any future resolution is in sight.

Hosted by Bel Trew, The Independent’s award-winning chief international correspondent, photographer and documentary filmmaker, the panel is part of The Independent’s Virtual Events series.

Across multiple trips since the start of Russia’s invasion, Bel has been charting the devastating impact of the war on people all over Ukraine.

Our panel includes Mykola Kuleba, founder of Save Ukraine, Ukrainian social and political activist and former Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

With over 25 years’ experience advocating for children’s rights, Mykola is a globally recognized child protection expert and has received several international awards for his work, including the Oxi Courage Award and the Manhae Peace Award 2023.

Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme and head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House will also be joining our panel. Orysia’s research focuses on social change, the role of civil society in democratic transition in Eastern Europe and, most recently, democratic resilience to foreign encroachment. She is the author of several Chatham House research publications, including Resilient Ukraine: Safeguarding Society from Russian Aggression (with Mathieu Boulègue, 2020).

Our third panellist is Tymofiy Mylovanov, President of Kyiv School of Economics and an advisor to Ukraine’s presidential administration.

During his professional career, he has taught at a number of European and American universities, including Rheinische Friedrich–Wilhelms–Universität Bonn, the University of Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh.

Tymofiy’s research interests cover such areas as game theory and institutional design. He has been published in leading international academic journals including Econometrica, American Economic Review and the Review of Economic Studies.

The event will be hosted on Zoom and will last one hour. It will take place on Thursday 22 February and will start at 4.30pm GMT.

President Joe Biden on Friday said Russian president Vladimir Putin is responsible for the death of Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who is reported to have died in a Russian penal colony in Siberia after several years of imprisonment for opposing Mr Putin’s regime.

In remarks delivered from the White House before he departed for an event in Ohio, Mr Biden said he was “not surprised” and “outraged” by reports that Navalny had died.

He described the late anti-corruption activist as having “bravely stood up to the corruption, the violence and all the bad things that Putin’s government was doing”.

“In response, Putin had him poisoned. He had him arrested and prosecuted for fabricated crimes,” then “sent to prison and held in isolation,” said Mr Biden, who added that it was “kind of amazing” that Navalny kept up his criticism of the Putin regime from behind bars.

“Even in prison, he was a powerful voice for the truth,” Mr Biden said, recalling how Navalny could have remained safe in exile following a 2020 poisoning attempt on his life by Russian security services but chose to return to his homeland even at the risk of being arrested and killed.

“He did it anyway, because he believed so deeply in his country and Russia ... but make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death,” he said. “What happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin’s brutality”.

Mr Biden continued to eulogise Navalny and compare him favourably to the man he opposed, Mr Putin, telling reporters that the Russian people would mourn Navalny as having been “so many things that Putin was not”.

“He was brave, he was principled, he was dedicated to building a Russia where the rule of law existed and where it applied to everybody,” he said.

Continuing, the president said Navalny’s death is a reminder of “the stakes of this moment,” and called on the House of Representatives to enact the supplemental appropriations bill he has called for that would fund Ukraine’s continued defence against Russian invading forces.

“We have to provide the funding so Ukraine can keep defending itself against Putin's vicious onslaught of war crimes,” he said.

He added that “history is watching” the lower chamber, where Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has thus far chosen to heed the wishes of Mr Biden’s pro-Russian opponent in the 2024 election, former president Donald Trump, who has repeatedly railed against funding for Ukraine and pushed his GOP allies to block it.

“The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment, will never be forgotten. It's gonna be down in the pages of history. It really is. It's consequential. And the clock is ticking and this has to happen,” he said.

Asked whether he believed Navalny’s death to have been an “assassination,” Mr Biden said his administration has not yet determined exactly what happened to the late opposition leader.

But he told reporters there was “no doubt” that Navalny’s death “was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did”.

He also said his administration is “looking at a whole number of options” to fulfil a promise he made during his 2021 summit with Mr Putin in Geneva. At the time, Mr Biden vowed to impose “devastating consequences” on Russia in the event Navalny died in government custody.

He added that “in the meantime,” Russia has suffered “a hell of a lot of consequences” as a result of the unlawful invasion of Ukraine ordered by Mr Putin nearly two years ago.

Turning to the subject of Mr Trump, the president repeated some of the harsh criticism he’d levelled his predecessor earlier this week after Mr Trump told attendees at an event in South Carolina that he’d threatened to allow Russia to freely attack Nato members that don’t spend enough on defence.

Donald Trump says he would encourage Russia to attack Nato allies who pay too little

“All of us should reject the dangerous statements made by the previous president that invited Russia to invade our Nato allies if they weren't paying up. He said if an ally did not pay their dues, he encouraged Russia to ‘do whatever the hell they want,’” he said.

Mr Biden appeared to pause for several seconds, as if he was holding his tongue from uttering language not suitable for a nationally televised speech.

He then quipped that he should clear his head rather than say what he was really thinking, and instead condemned Mr Trump’s remarks as “an outrageous thing for a president to say”.

He added that the US would be standing by the “sacred” commitment to its’ Nato allies as long as he is in the Oval Office, just as Nato has stood by the US in the past, and said Mr Putin “should know” that the US will continue to “defend every inch of Nato territory” against “any adversary” that attacks any member state.",Resume197,[],2024-02-16 18:46:27+00:00,"['navalny', 'brutality', 'russian', 'death', 'biden', 'russia', 'president', 'proof', 'nato', 'email', 'mr', 'putin', 'putins']",the_independent_articles

The US is investigating several Israeli airstrikes that killed civilians as part of a broader probe into the use of American-supplied weapons in the war against Hamas, according to the Wall Street Journal.

One of the incidents being investigated by State Department is a 31 October is an Israeli strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza with a 2,000lb bomb, which may have been provided by the US, that killed more than 125 people, according to US officials.

The United Nations said that strike , among others, could constitute a war crime. The investigation is said to be concerned with assessing whether Israel has complied with international law.

News of the investigation comes as president Joe Biden comes under increasing pressure from within his own party over his unconditional support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza. The president has described Israel’s campaign, which has killed some 28,000 Palestinians, as “over the top,” but his officials have ruled out conditioning future US support to Israel to influence Israel’s conduct.

It is unclear, however, whether the probe will lead to any meaningful US policy change or consequences for one of America’s closest allies. State Department spokesman Matt Miller said on Tuesday that the process was “not intended to function as a rapid response mechanism.”

“Rather, it is designed to systematically assess civilian harm incidents and develop appropriate policy responses to reduce the risk of such incidents occurring in the future,” he said, according to the WSJ.

The strike on the Jabalia is ranked as one of the worst civilian casualty events of the entire war, which was launched by Israel in response to a Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people. Israeli’s retaliation has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

At a briefing attended by The Independent, Israeli military officials said the strike was aimed at eliminating Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari, which justified the bombing.

“It was not only a legitimate military target but an important military target to strike – and all things were factored in including the possibility of non-combatants being affected,” IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said at the briefing.

The State Department is also investigating Israel’s possible use of white phosphorus in Lebanon in fighting against the militant group Hezbollah, the WSJ reported. Israel has said that its use of the highly flammable compound complies with international law.

The reports of US investigations into Israeli strikes were first reported by HuffPost , which also noted that the White House had previously denied knowledge of such an investigation.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters in January that he was “not aware of any kind of formal assessment being done by the United States government to analyze the compliance with international law by our partner Israel.”

“We have not seen anything that would convince us that we need to take a different approach in terms of trying to help Israel defend itself,” he added.

Russia has fired its first hypersonic missile since the summer, the British Ministry of Defence has claimed, after months of building up a large stockpile in time for a winter attack on Ukraine.

The UK MoD claimed that Russia fired one of its Killjoy missiles at a Ukrainian air base west of Kyiv last Thursday. At the time, the Ukrainian air force said Russia had fired three hypersonic missiles, one at Kyiv and two at the Starokostyantyniv military air base, and they had shot down one.

It declined to comment on whether the two hypersonic missiles it failed to shoot down that day had caused damage to the military air base.

It is the first time Russia has fired a hypersonic missile since August, according to the MoD intelligence update.

In late November, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, warned that Russia was stockpiling missiles for a second winter-long missile campaign targeting critical infrastructure miles behind the frontlines in civilian-populated Ukraine.

He said that he expected to see “new attempts to strike Ukraine’s power grid and energy infrastructure, trying to leave Ukraine in the dark and cold”.

Ahead of this campaign, The Independent looks at what excatly hypersonic missiles are and why Ukraine’s repulsion of these weapons could be vital.

What are hypersonic missiles?

Hypersonic missiles are thought to represent the next generation of arms. Russia’s Kinzhal hypersonics, classified as AS-24 Killjoys by Nato, make up the body of the Kremlin’s stockpile.

The Kinzhals can travel at exceptionally high velocities – up to ten times the speed of sound, which is around 8,000mph. By comparison, a subsonic cruise missile like the US Air Force’s Tomahawk rocket moves at a relatively sluggish 550mph.

Kinzhals are typically carried by MiG-31K fighter jets (AP)

Kinzhals are typically carried by MiG-31K fighter jets and can hit targets as far away as 1,250 miles, their speed, mid-flight manoeuvrability and ability to fly at low altitudes making them difficult to track using radar on the ground and therefore near-impossible to stop.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the Kinzhal can carry a nuclear warhead as well as a conventional explosive, a strategy it has been feared Russia could resort to as its war becomes ever-more desperate and drawn-out than expected due to the heroic resistance put up by the locals, well armed by their international allies.

Which countries have them?

Australia, the UK and US, together known as the Aukus nations, previously announced a plan to expand their military pact to collaborate on the development of hypersonic missiles and anti-hypersonic weapons.

In April 2022, the then-prime ministers of Australia and Britain, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson, joined Joe Biden in issuing a joint statement saying their countries would “commence new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as to expand information sharing and to deepen co-operation on defence innovation”.

“These initiatives will add to our existing efforts to deepen cooperation on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities.”

The Aukus deal was initially signed to concentrate on nuclear submarine development with a wary eye on potential Chinese aggression in the Pacific, but focus has now shifted towards the threat posed by Vladimir Putin.

Russia’s defence ministry has already said its forces have fired hypersonic ballistic missiles in the conflict, claiming to have destroyed a fuel depot in the Black Sea city of Mykolaiv and an underground ammunition store in western Ivano-Frankivsk.

How effective are they?

Military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has argued that the use of such weapons will make little difference on the ground and that their true value is “giving a certain psychological and propaganda effect”.

In other words, inspiring terror.

Mr Putin has boasted of Russia’s investment in such “invincible” weaponry, justifying doing so as a response to what he considers to be Nato military expansion on his country’s doorstep in Eastern Europe.

The US and China are said to be working on their own versions, as are the navies of Britain and France, who are understood to have been collaborating on one known as Perseus since 2011, although it is not expected to enter service for another seven years or so.

What’s happening in the US?

President Joe Biden on Monday said Israel’s planned military operation against Hamas in the Gazan city of Rafah “should not proceed without a credible plan” to ensure “safety and support” for the more than one million civilians who’ve taken shelter there since Israel started its offensive against Hamas in the wake of the 7 October terror attacks.

Speaking alongside King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House, Mr Biden said he and the Jordanian leader discussed both the Israeli operation and the status of civilians there.

“Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable — they need to be protected,” Mr Biden said.

Israeli airstrikes killed more than 100 people in the city overnight, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Around half of Gaza’s pre-war population is now crammed into sprawling tent encampments and overcrowded UN shelters after fleeing from Israel’s offensive further north.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week called for his military to develop a plan to evacuate the city ahead of a planned attack on Hamas holdouts there, as aid agencies warned any such move would be a “bloodbath.”

The president said he has been “clear” from the start of the conflict about US opposition to any “forced displacement” of Palestinians and stressed that he has been in contact with partners in the region to ensure a more steady flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, both from the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border and from other points of access.

“We’re working to open other routes as well. And we’re also working relentlessly to make sure aid workers can get the aid where it’s needed,” said Mr Biden, who noted that both the Jordanian leader and members of his family have piloted planes used to airdrop medical and other supplies into Gaza.

The president also reiterated the longstanding US support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and said the de facto government led by the Palestinian Authority must “urgently reform” to prepare to take over both the West Bank and Gaza after Hamas, which has controlled the latter territory since 2007, has been brought down.

“Once Hamas’ control of Gaza is over, they must prepare to build a state that accepts peace, does not harbour terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and together we will keep working to complete what we started — to integrate the region, to bring about peace between Israel and all its Arab neighbours, including the Palestinian state,” he said.

While the American president has expressed support for what he has described as an extended “pause” in fighting — something the US has taken pains to differentiate from a hypothetical ceasefire — King Abdullah appeared to harbour no reservations about calling for a full stop to the fighting on both sides, citing an “unbearable” situation in Rafah that is “certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe” should Israel follow through on plans to attack.

“We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire, now — this war must end,” he said.

The King, who spoke English tinged with a hint of British accent acquired while attending St Edmund’s School in Hindhead, Surrey as a child, said all parties “must urgently and immediately work to ensure the sustainable delivery of sufficient aid to Gaza through all possible entry points and mechanisms” and called for a resumption of full support for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which has come under fire in recent days after some of its’ employees were found to have links to the 7 October attacks.

“Restrictions on vital relief aid and medical items are leading to inhumane conditions. No other UN agency can do what UNRWA is doing in helping the people of Gaza through this humanitarian catastrophe,” he said. “It is imperative that UNRWA continues to receive the support it needs to carry out its mandate”.

The King echoed Mr Biden’s opposition to any displacement of Palestinians from Rafah, telling reporters that the “potential threat of Palestinian displacement beyond the borders of Gaza and the West Bank is something we view with extreme concern and cannot be allowed”.

The leaders’ comments came just hours after National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US would not support the Israeli offensive absent “a proper, executable, effective and credible plan for the safety of the more than a million Palestinians that are taking refuge there.“

Mr Kirby said that evacuating Rafah in a way that protects civilians would be a “heavy lift, but that’s the conversation that we want to keep having with our Israeli counterparts.”

When asked if he believes it’s realistic or viable for Israel to have a goal of moving civilians out of the path of their planned operation in Rafah, Mr Kirby replied: ""Let’s see what the Israeli Defense Forces come up with.""

“We can’t tell you what’s going to look like, that’s really for the IDF to speak to, but it absolutely has to be accounted for,” he said.

""We wouldn’t support operations given the current circumstances where you have, again, more than a million people there with nowhere to go and no plan for them to go so that they can be safe,” he added.

Mr Netanyahu told ABC News on Sunday that Israel would provide “safe passage” to civilians wishing to leave Rafah.

When asked where they could go, the Israeli prime minister said: “You know, the areas that we’ve cleared north of Rafah, plenty of areas there. But we are working out a detailed plan.”

But aid agencies operating on the ground in Gaza, and even Israel’s Western allies, have expressed scepticism that a plan to evacuate 1.5 million people from Rafah safely exists.

""No war can be allowed in a gigantic refugee camp,"" said Jan Egeland, Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warning of a ""bloodbath"" if Israeli operations expand there.

UN humanitarian co-ordinator Jamie McGoldrick told the BBC that people in Rafah would have ""nowhere to go"" in the event of an Israeli offensive.

""The safe areas that were declared are no longer safe. And if these people have to move – where can they move? We are really fearful of the horrific nature of where we are could only ever get worse,"" he said.

British foreign secretary David Cameron said that Israel should “stop and think seriously” before taking further action in Rafah.

He added that is “impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go”.

Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Forcing the over one million displaced Palestinians in Rafah to again evacuate without a safe place to go would be unlawful and would have catastrophic consequences. There is nowhere safe to go in Gaza.”

More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s offensive in the densely populated territory, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The war was launched by Israel in response to a surprise Hamas attack on 7 October that killed 1,200 people. Some 250 people were also kidnapped and taken back to Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to abandon a visit to Gaza’s border to oversee aid deliveries because Israeli protesters were blocking shipments of food into the territory, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

Mr Blinken has faced fierce criticism from humanitarian groups and European allies in recent days after the US froze funding for UNRWA, the largest aid agency on the ground in Gaza, at a time when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are facing an escalating hunger crisis and risk of famine .

It comes amid reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his military to prepare for an invasion of Rafah, the last refuge in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands fled to at the orders of the invading army.

The secretary of state’s trip to the Kerem Shalom crossing was reportedly planned so that he could evaluate the passage of much-needed aid into Gaza. But it was abandoned due to the presence of protesters linked to extremist settler groups who have been disrupting aid shipments into the beleaguered territory for several weeks.

The protesters have demanded that no food enter Gaza until hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the 7 October attacks are released. Deliveries have also been blocked by the Israeli army, which inspects all aid trucks going into Gaza.

A “preparatory tour” of the crossing by Israeli police, army, foreign ministry representatives and members of Mr Blinken’s security detail had taken place ahead of the planned visit, according to Haaretz, which cited several people familiar with the planning. On the day of the tour, however, protesters managed to block nine trucks from entering.

When Israeli police couldn’t guarantee that they would be able to stop the protesters doing the same during Mr Blinken’s visit, the trip was abandoned to avoid embarrassing the secretary of state, according to the report.

At a press conference on Wednesday at the US embassy in Jerusalem, Mr Blinken denied that there was a visit planned, telling reporters that “there was no planned visit to Kerem Shalom so there was nothing to cancel”.

The alleged cancellation of the trip further highlights a contradiction in US policy towards the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Mr Blinken has spoken often about the delivery of aid to Palestinians as a top priority, but his administration has been accused by aid groups of worsening the crisis.

Hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are starving as a result of Israel’s war against Hamas, according to aid agencies on the ground . But an even greater number of Palestinian lives may soon be at risk due to a decision by the US and its allies to freeze funding to UNRWA – the United Nations agency responsible for Palestinian refugees – following reports that a small number of employees were involved in those attacks.

UNRWA has warned it may run out of money as early as this month, a worst-case scenario that aid groups have warned could cause widespread famine and death .

Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said of the decision: “Famine was imminent. Famine is now inevitable.”

The move also drew condemnation from US allies. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called the freezing of UNRWA funds “disproportionate and dangerous”.

“The wrongdoing of individuals should never lead to the collective punishment of an entire population,” he wrote in a blog post .

The UNRWA was already struggling to operate effectively in Gaza before the freeze. It received just half of the funds it needed to meet the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the war. Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and widespread bombing across the strip have made delivering aid almost impossible, and at least 152 of its staffers have been killed in the bombardment, according to the agency.

Other aid agencies have warned that they do not possess the capability to fill the gap left by UNRWA should it halt operations. Today, UNRWA says more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing “catastrophic hunger,” and the risk of famine increases every day.

That risk has been increased by the decision by Israel to block a significant number of aid trucks from entering Gaza. The UN said that 80 per cent of aid deliveries destined for northern Gaza were blocked by the Israeli army in January .

More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s offensive in the densely populated territory, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The war was launched in response to a surprise attack by Hamas militants on 7 October that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Some 250 people were also kidnapped and taken back to Gaza.

Hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are starving as a result of Israel’s war against Hamas, according to aid agencies on the ground. But an even greater number of Palestinian lives may soon be at risk due to a decision by the US and its allies to freeze funding to the primary aid agency operating in the territory, following reports that a small number of employees were involved in the October 7 attacks.

Now, the United Nations agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, has warned it may run out of money as early as this month, a worst-case scenario that aid groups have warned could cause widespread famine and death.

“They will die of hunger, they will die because they don’t have the insulin that UNRWA brings in, or they will die because a woman had a complicated childbirth and there was no UNRWA midwife to help her,” said Juliette Touma, director of communications at UNRWA.

The fate of Gaza’s two million people has long been inextricably tied to UNRWA. Even before the war, it provided the basic necessities for people to survive in the blockaded territory, such as food, medicine and fuel. But today, like the population it serves, it is battling for survival.

The agency has struggled to operate effectively in Gaza since the beginning of the war — which was launched by Israel in response to a surprise Hamas attack on 7 October that killed 1,200 people. The agency received just half of the funds it needed to meet the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the war. Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and widespread bombing across the strip have made delivering aid almost impossible, and at least 152 of its staffers have been killed in the bombardment, according to the agency.

UNRWA warned in December that nearly half of Gaza’s population was “at risk of famine” due to the war. Then, last week, its funding was abruptly cut in half when the US and several other countries froze their contributions after Israel said that a dozen of the agency’s staff were involved in the Hamas attack.

As a result of the freeze, and the dramatic increase in the needs of Gaza’s population due to the war, UNRWA could run of out money as early as this month, Ms Touma told The Independent. That would have an unfathomable impact on the already beleaguered people of Gaza.

“In short, people will die totally unnecessarily,” said Ms Touma, adding that everything from food, drinking water, medicine and generators for hospitals would all be impacted by the funding cuts.

Ms Touma recently returned from a visit to Gaza and witnessed the humanitarian crisis first-hand. She describes a landscape of tens of thousands of makeshift shelters and a mass of people moving constantly to escape the bombing and find food. Private enterprise has all but collapsed, and where it does exist, prices are exorbitant. She said that a single egg now costs around 70 US cents.

“It’s as if they’re are operating in this auto mode for survival, fixated with being safe, finding food, finding water, finding a toilet,” she said.

Ms Touma described the people she met as “tired and terrified and anxious.”

More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s offensive in the densely populated territory, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Some 80 per cent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting. Israel’s offensive is now pressing further south towards the city of Rafah, where most of those displaced people are now sheltering.

Other aid agencies have warned that they do not possess the capability to fill the gap left by UNRWA should it halt operations. Today, UNRWA says more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing “catastrophic hunger,” and the risk of famine increases every day.

“This is why these decisions are shocking, because they come at a time when we are at very high risk of famine, especially in the northern parts,” Ms Touma said. “There is an ongoing war and the UN is running one of the largest humanitarian and most complex operations, so this comes in the middle of that.”

UNRWA, or the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, was founded in 1949 to provide specifically for the Palestinians who either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Today, it supports some six million Palestinian refugees across the occupied West Bank – including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

The allegations about a dozen staffers from the agency being involved in the October 7 massacres came to light more than three months after the Hamas attack. UNRWA itself was the first to announce the news, on 26 January, that Israel had provided it with information that 12 of its 13,000 staff operating in Gaza were involved in the Hamas attack and kidnapping of some 240 people in southern Israel.

Israel alleges dozens more are affiliated in some way with Hamas and its ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. At a briefing with UN ambassadors last week to discuss the allegations, Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant said that UNRWA had “lost its legitimacy to exist”.

The agency’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said he had terminated the contracts of those suspected, launched an investigation into the “shocking” allegations and declared that “any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.”

The announcement came on the same day that the International Criminal Court (ICJ) found that it was “plausible” that Israel has committed acts of genocide against the Palestinians.

The US, Germany, the UK and eight other donors immediately paused funding to UNRWA pending an investigation. UNRWA estimates that about $440 million in funding is at risk. The US provided about $344 million of funding in 2022, making it by far the largest donor.

The State Department said that most of its 2023 funding had already been allocated , but its freeze means that Congress cannot allocate any further funds, which had been due to happen this summer. Even then, the funding would face stiff opposition in Congress, where Republican and Democratic senators this week agreed on a bipartisan deal that would bar all funding for UNRWA to be permanently withdrawn in light of the allegations, while delivering $14.1bn to Israel.

Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, was among the few voices calling for an immediate restoration of funding, warning that “hundreds of thousands of children face starvation and disease” as a result.

“Obviously, it’s not acceptable for any of the 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza to be involved with Hamas, and allegations against the 12 people charged must be investigated. However, we cannot allow millions to suffer because of the actions of 12 people. The US and other countries must restore funding to stave off this humanitarian catastrophe,” he said in a statement .

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said of the allegations that “we haven’t had the ability to investigate [the allegations] ourselves. But they are highly, highly credible.”

A UN oversight agency is currently conducting an investigation into the allegations and expects to provide a preliminary report in several weeks , but the US has not been clear about what it would take for the funding to be restored.

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby that the US “absolutely shares those concerns” about the risk of Gaza’s humanitarian crisis being exacerbated by the shortfall in US funding for UNRWA when questioned by The Independent.

“We’re concerned about that, no question about it. Now, look, we suspended funding temporarily to UNRWA as they do this investigation. We believe it was the right thing to do to stop that funding while they investigate and we’ll see how that investigation goes. We’ll see what they learn and we’ll see what accountability measures they put in place,” he said.

The UN is now rushing to solicit funding from alternative donors to prevent the halt of its operations. The most serious risk is a widespread famine in Gaza, but the agency also provides schooling and medical care to millions of Palestinians across the region.

Ms Touma said the halting of UNRWA operations would be a “bleak day, not only for Palestinian refugees or people impacted by the war in Gaza, but for the whole region.”

“UNRWA is a fundamental player and a contributor to the stability in a region that is a tinderbox.

Hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are starving as a result of Israel’s war against Hamas, according to aid agencies on the ground. But an even greater number of Palestinian lives may soon be at risk due to a decision by the US and its allies to freeze funding to the primary aid agency operating in the territory, following reports that a small number of employees were involved in the October 7 attacks.

Now, the United Nations agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, has warned it may run out of money as early as this month, a worst-case scenario that aid groups have warned could cause widespread famine and death.

“They will die of hunger, they will die because they don’t have the insulin that UNRWA brings in, or they will die because a woman had a complicated childbirth and there was no UNRWA midwife to help her,” said Juliette Touma, director of communications at UNRWA.

The fate of Gaza’s two million people has long been inextricably tied to UNRWA. Even before the war, it provided the basic necessities for people to survive in the blockaded territory, such as food, medicine and fuel. But today, like the population it serves, it is battling for survival.

The agency has struggled to operate effectively in Gaza since the beginning of the war — which was launched by Israel in response to a surprise Hamas attack on 7 October that killed 1,200 people. The agency received just half of the funds it needed to meet the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the war. Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and widespread bombing across the strip have made delivering aid almost impossible, and at least 152 of its staffers have been killed in the bombardment, according to the agency.

UNRWA warned in December that nearly half of Gaza’s population was “at risk of famine” due to the war. Then, last week, its funding was abruptly cut in half when the US and several other countries froze their contributions after Israel said that a dozen of the agency’s staff were involved in the Hamas attack.

As a result of the freeze, and the dramatic increase in the needs of Gaza’s population due to the war, UNRWA could run of out money as early as this month, Ms Touma told The Independent. That would have an unfathomable impact on the already beleaguered people of Gaza.

“In short, people will die totally unnecessarily,” said Ms Touma, adding that everything from food, drinking water, medicine and generators for hospitals would all be impacted by the funding cuts.

Ms Touma recently returned from a visit to Gaza and witnessed the humanitarian crisis first-hand. She describes a landscape of tens of thousands of makeshift shelters and a mass of people moving constantly to escape the bombing and find food. Private enterprise has all but collapsed, and where it does exist, prices are exorbitant. She said that a single egg now costs around 70 US cents.

“It’s as if they’re are operating in this auto mode for survival, fixated with being safe, finding food, finding water, finding a toilet,” she said.

Ms Touma described the people she met as “tired and terrified and anxious.”

More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s offensive in the densely populated territory, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Some 80 per cent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting. Israel’s offensive is now pressing further south towards the city of Rafah, where most of those displaced people are now sheltering.

Other aid agencies have warned that they do not possess the capability to fill the gap left by UNRWA should it halt operations. Today, UNRWA says more than 500,000 people in Gaza are facing “catastrophic hunger,” and the risk of famine increases every day.

“This is why these decisions are shocking, because they come at a time when we are at very high risk of famine, especially in the northern parts,” Ms Touma said. “There is an ongoing war and the UN is running one of the largest humanitarian and most complex operations, so this comes in the middle of that.”

UNRWA, or the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, was founded in 1949 to provide specifically for the Palestinians who either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Today, it supports some six million Palestinian refugees across the occupied West Bank – including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

The US launched airstrikes against Iranian forces and allied militias in Iraq and Syria on Friday as it began its retaliation for a drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan last week.

Dozens of strikes launched by long-range bombers flown from the US targeted Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups just hours after president Joe Biden received the remains of the three service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.

Mr Biden said in a statement that he had ordered US military forces to strike at “facilities that the IRGC and affiliated militia use to attack US forces.”

“Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond,” Mr Biden said.

The strikes began at midnight local time and hit more than 85 targets with more than 125 precision munitions, the Pentagon said in a statement. They targeted four locations in Syria, and three in Iraq.

“The facilities that were struck included command and control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aired vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces,” the statement said.

It is yet unclear what impact the strikes will have on the militias after many claimed to have evacuated bases or went into hiding after days of US warnings that a “multi-tiered” response was imminent. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Pentagon was still assessing the results of the military action, “but we believe that the strikes were successful.”

The decision to strike directly at the IRGC marks a significant escalation in a volatile regional power struggle that pits the US against Iran and a network of allied armed groups across the Middle East. Previous US airstrikes have targeted only the militias, but not their backer.

US forces in the region have come under frequent attack for years by Iran-linked militias opposed to their presence in the region, but those attacks have increased dramatically in the wake of the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, and Israel’s invasion of Gaza in response.

US bases have been struck by more than 160 rocket and drone attacks in Iraq and Syria since mid-October by Iran-backed militias who view the US as complicit in the devastation caused by the Gaza war due to its support for Israel. US warships and international merchant vessels have come under frequent attack from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are also backed by Iran.

Concerns have been growing over the spread of violence across the Middle East linked to Israel’s war in Gaza, which was triggered by an attack by Hamas inside Israel in which around 1,200 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Israel’s war against Hamas, which is allied with Iran, has drawn in Iran’s allies from across the region – from Yemen’s Houthis to Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Israel’s war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry, which the United Nations and other aid groups deem reliable.

The Biden administration has said repeatedly that it hoped to prevent a wider regional escalation as a result of the Israel-Hamas war, but the intervention of the Houthis and the killing of US soldiers has resulted in a series of military confrontations that resemble a low-level regional war. The US now regularly carries out strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, as well as Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.

When questioned by The Independent about whether the US classifies the fighting on multiple fronts as a war, Mr Kirby said he disagreed.

“There were attacks against our troops and facilities in Iraq and Syria well before 7 October – certainly in the last administration as well,” he said on Thursday. “And as for the Houthis, they can claim all they want that this is linked to Gaza but two-thirds of the ships that they’re hitting have no connection to Israel whatsoever. So, it’s just not true. It’s a falsehood.”

Other White House officials contacted by The Independent have shied away from even the suggestion that the series of interconnected conflicts in which the US is embroiled constitutes a regional war, and Mr Biden has insisted that he does not need to seek approval from Congress before this or any other retaliatory strikes against the Iran-backed militias, including strikes against the Houthis carried out by American and British forces over the last several weeks.

These latest strikes, which US officials have privately described as the opening salvos in what will be a longer retaliatory campaign, come after three US service personnel were killed and 34 wounded by a drone strike on a military outpost in Jordan known as Tower 22, on the border between Iraq and Syria. It marked the first time US soldiers have been killed by the attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

The Pentagon named the fallen soldiers on Monday as Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Georgia; Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Georgia; and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Georgia.

The White House said it had determined that the attack was carried out by a loose alliance of Iran-backed militias in the region.

“We believe that the attack in Jordan was a plan resourced and facilitated by an umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which contains multiple groups, including Kataib Hezbollah,” Mr Kirby said.

US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin said on Thursday that the military response to those deaths will be “multi-tiered”.

“Again, we have the ability to respond a number of times, depending on what the situation is,” he added.

Following the strikes on Friday, he reiterated that more strikes were likely to follow.

“This is the start of our response. The President has directed additional actions to hold the IRGC and affiliated militias accountable for their attacks on US and Coalition Forces,” he said in a statement.

President Biden told reporters on Wednesday that he had decided on a response to the attacks but did not want an escalation in fighting.

“I don’t think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That’s not what I’m looking for,” he said.

Two people have been arrested after protesters hurled pumpkin soup at the Mona Lisa painting in Paris.

Visitors at the Louvre gallery watched in shock as a woman threw liquid from a tin onto the Leonardo da Vinci painting, one of the word’s most famous artworks.

Paris police said they had arrested two people in connection with the action, according to the AP news agency.

In footage of the incident, the pair are demanding the right to “healthy and sustainable food” saying “our agricultural system is sick”.

They shout: “What’s the most important thing? Art, or right to healthy and sustainable food?

“Our farming system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work.”

The pair then cross a boundary between the painting and public and stand beside the artwork, their right hands held up in a salute. Staff rush in to cover up the mess, propping up black protective panels.

Both protesters wore a T-shirt saying Riposte Alimentaire, which translates as ”food counterattack” and is the name of the activist group who have taken responsibility for the stunt.

They describe themselves as a collective which seeks to highlight the need to protect sustainable food.

A statement sent to the AFP news agency says the action marks the “start of a campaign of civil resistance with the clear demand... of the social security of sustainable food”.

The Louvre said that members of the group sprayed pumpkin soup on the painting at around 10:00am local time (09:00 GMT), and that there was no damage.

It said the Salle des Etats, where the work is displayed, was evacuated at the time and reopened to visitors shortly after at 11:30am local time (10:30 GMT).

They added: “The museum will lodge a complaint.”

The image, which is more than 500 years old, sits behind protected glass since the 1950s to protect it after an acid attack. It was upgraded to armoured glass in 2005.

French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati sent her support to staff at the Louvre and said that “no cause can justify it being targeted”.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, she said: “The Mona Lisa like our heritage belongs to future generations.”

After the incident, management at the Louvre opened a crisis unit, closing the room holding the Mona Lisa for cleaning.

The action comes after days of protests by farmers over rising fuel costs and changing regulations. Cabbages, tomatoes and other food was seen strewn across the highway as their protest entered its second week.

In 2022, a cake was thrown at the image in a demonstration against climate change. A man disguised as an elderly woman in a wheelchair threw cake at the famous painting.

Beauty giant Avon has come under fire for continuing to operate its business in Russia despite the country’s ongoing war in Ukraine.

In a new investigation, the BBC discovered the UK based company is not only actively recruiting new sales agents in Russia but operating a significant production operation in Moscow.

In March 2022, at the outbreak of the invasion of Ukraine it had announced that it would be suspending all investments in Russia and would “stop exporting products from the Russian factory to all other markets”.

Its parent company Natura & Co had previously insisted it would only maintain Russian links in the interests of women and children there who would experience “an outsize impact” if their access to products was restricted.

Yet the investigation found Avon’s business dealings extended beyond just supporting existing salespeople, with the company clearly recruiting new agents in Russia.

The brand has international reach and has launched new physical stores and pivoted to social media sales (PA)

Registration as a new sales agent for the firm is still live and prizes, cash bonuses and holidays are offered for hitting targets.

Avon Russia’s YouTube channel also appears to show senior managers promoting the value of sales training at Avon and award ceremonies for agents.

Avon, which was founded 137 years ago, has been doing business in Russia for the last thirty years. According to its Russian website, it is the number one perfume brand in the country.

The company prides itself on providing “critical support” for women operating as independent entrepreneurs around family commitments.

“It is only maintaining local product operations in support of Representatives who operate as independent entrepreneurs,” Natura & Co had said in a statement on their website.

“We believe the world must unite and stand together for peace while acting with solidarity with all people impacted by this unacceptable aggression against human rights in Ukraine.”

Mark Dixon, founder of the Moral Rating Agency, which spotlights corporate links with Russia in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, accused Avon of “moral-washing”.

The brand has been renowned for providing women with opportunities around family commitments (PA)

He told the BBC: “How can [Avon] in good faith sell products for women and children from a company that supports the economy behind Putin’s invasion of Ukraine?”

More than 2.5 billion units have been manufactured in the Naro-Fominsk plant which opened in Moscow in 2004 and appears to now only serve the Russian market.

Avon produces more than 220 types of cosmetics and perfumes from the location - although Avon told the BBC the plant exclusively serves the Russian market. Natura & Co insists the firm has no “financial advantage” from being in Russia.

An Avon spokesperson said: “Avon Russia supports women in Russia through locally funded activities to support their social selling businesses.

“We see this as critical support for women whose livelihoods depend on their Avon business.”",Resume209,[],2024-01-28 09:40:19+00:00,"['russian', 'sign', 'avon', 'business', 'giant', 'recruiting', 'verifyerrors', 'russia', 'despite', 'ukraine', 'war', 'sales', 'support', 'women', 'beauty', 'company']",the_independent_articles

The US is carrying out airstrikes in three countries across the Middle East. It has sent billions of dollars in military hardware and is providing tactical support for its closest ally in the region, which is embroiled in a war against one militant group and almost daily skirmishes with another on its northern border. US forces in two of those countries have been attacked more than 150 times in the last three months, and the de-facto ruling power in an impoverished country in the Red Sea has brought international shipping there to a grinding halt.

It was not announced with great ceremony, as previous American adventures in the Middle have been – in fact, it was not announced at all. But the US is now embroiled in a regional war against an alliance of Iran-backed militant groups spread from Syria to Yemen. That war is being conducted with little congressional oversight, and with little acknowledgement from the Biden administration of the scale of the fighting.

It is an outcome that the Biden administration has claimed to have worked hard to prevent, but analysts say that the president’s unconditional support of Israel’s war against Hamas, in retaliation for the Palestinian group’s attack on 7 October, has ignited a tinderbox that will be difficult to contain.

“Unfortunately, we are now deep into a regional war and all the parties involved have made the worst possible miscalculations,” says Thanassis Cambanis, senior fellow and director of Century International, who warned of such an eventuality in the early days of the Israel-Hamas war.

Indeed, the Biden administration’s two main priorities in the aftermath of the Hamas attack seemed incompatible from the start. Mr Biden promised unconditional support for Israel’s war in Gaza, and to prevent that conflict spiralling into a wider regional war. But Mr Cambanis argues it was precisely the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, and refusal to use its leverage to pressure Israel to end it, that fuelled the regional escalation.

“The most important step to calming the wider regional conflict is ending the war in Gaza. It has been thus from the very beginning,” he tells The Independent. “The US retains a lot of leverage it has sadly chosen not to use and it continues to be a central driver of the conflict.”

In the early days of the conflict, Mr Biden achieved the first of his objectives – supporting Israel’s ability to attack Hamas in Gaza – by sending hundreds of millions of dollars of military supplies to Israel, bypassing Congress to do so speedily.

Then, to deter any Hamas allies from joining the fray, the US sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean. The US was particularly concerned about the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which fought a devastating war against Israel in 2006. In an interview given just days after the Hamas attack, Mr Biden issued a stark warning: “To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word: Don’t.”

Those words would fall on deaf ears, however.

Israel’s fight with Hamas in Gaza is at the centre of this conflict, but it is also just one part of a greater proxy war between rivals Israel and Iran. The Islamic Republic has spent years building a network of allied militant groups opposed to Israel under a concept referred to as “unity of the fronts”. Those groups – which include the Syrian government, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Houthi rebels in Yemen and various Shia militant groups in Iraq and Syria – have been furnished with military training, financial support, missiles, and the ability to make their own missiles. All of them have now been drawn into the fight in some form.

As Israel pursued its war against Hamas with increasing ferocity, and the civilian toll rose by the day in the thousands, attacks against US interests spiked across the region. US military officials have counted more than 150 attacks against its troops in Iraq and Syria since 17 October. In early December, the US embassy in Baghdad was targeted with rocket fire.

Those attacks have continued as a steady drumbeat in the background of the devastating Gaza war. But it was the Lebanese group Hezbollah that gave the US the most concern.

Hezbollah and Israel have fought increasingly fierce skirmishes on the border for some months now. So far, the two have managed to prevent an all-out war, but that may not last forever. Speaking in early January, Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet and former defence minister, told reporters that “the stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out”.

“If the world and the Lebanese government don’t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it,” he said.

The US might have been able to deal with the small-scale attacks against its forces in Iraq and Syria. It was involved in Gaza, but only indirectly. And Hezbollah was largely avoiding action that could spark a wider conflict. But the biggest problem for the US came from an unexpected place.

The entry of Yemen’s Houthi rebels has opened a new front in the region for US forces. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group that controls most of Yemen and has survived a years-long US-backed bombing campaign by Saudi Arabia, inserted itself into the fray on 19 October, nearly two weeks after the Hamas attacks, when Israel’s bombing campaign against Gaza was well underway. On that day it fired a barrage of missiles and drones towards Israel and said the attacks would continue until the war stopped and humanitarian aid was delivered to Gaza.

For weeks these missiles, supplied by Iran, continued to be fired towards Israel. All of them were intercepted either by Israeli air defence or US warships in the region. Then, on 14 November, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi warned his group would target Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Less than a month later, the group started attacking all ships that it claimed were heading to Israel. In reality, it also targeted ships with tenuous or no links to the country at all.

Many shipping companies suspended passage through the Strait and global shipping was severely disrupted as a result. Global trade dropped by 1.3 per cent in December as a result of the disruption, and the number of shipping containers passing through the Red Sea fell by 60 per cent.

On 11 January, after the Houthis ignored repeated warnings, the US and the UK carried out air and missile strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The strikes targeted the capital Sana’a, as well as Sa’ada, Hajjah, Hudaydah, and Taiz governorates. The Pentagon says 60 targets were hit using more than 150 precision-guided munitions. “These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,” US president Joe Biden said.

With that, the US went from indirect involvement to a new bombing campaign in the Middle East. President Biden, outlining the justification for the strikes, said they intended to send “a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes”.

The US also redesignated the Houthis as a terror group, after the Biden administration had taken the group off the list in one of the first acts after entering the White House.

The strikes don’t seem to have halted the attacks, however. In the last week, there have been 30 attacks by the Houthis on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni writer and research fellow at Chatham House who has spent years writing about the US-backed Saudi bombing campaign of Yemen, and US strikes against Al Qaeda before that, believes the US is fighting a losing battle.

“Biden is in one of these moments where it’s damned if you do, and damned if you don’t. If you let the Houthis get away with this, it’s dangerous and bad for business. Then if you bomb them, you are escalating and opening another front line,” he said.

“But they have tried bombing for many years, with al-Qaeda. The Saudis tried it. And it doesn’t work in Yemen. So it seems to be that the policy of the current US administration is to be in a regional war without calling it one,” he added.

Mr al-Muslimi believes the US and others may have misunderstood, and perhaps underestimated the Houthis. Far from being a mere proxy of Iran, they have their own strategic reasons for stepping forward at this moment.

“First, when they say they support Palestine, they really mean that. They ideologically believe in that and think they can help,” he said.

“For them, Gaza is a chance to re-emerge as a power player. Can you think about it right now? Twenty years ago they were in flip-flops, now they are demanding the withdrawal of forces from Gaza and halting shipping in the Red Sea.”

Despite the continuing airstrikes against Houthi targets on Thursday, the Biden administration has downplayed the idea that the US is already engaged in a regional war.

""We don’t seek war, we don’t think we are at war. We don’t want to see a regional war,"" the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Thursday.

Colin P Clarke, senior fellow at the Soufan Center, described the many overlapping crises in the Middle East as a “perfect storm” for the Biden administration, and believes the reason why they are reluctant to concede the seriousness of the conflict may lie with domestic concerns.

“The stated goal of the administration from early on in the Gaza war was to prevent the conflict from spreading and becoming a regional war. Admitting we’re in a regional war would be akin to admitting a policy failure, not something you want to hand your opponents in an election year,” he said.

“So they just don’t admit it, and continue to plod forward while hoping this winds down, that seems to be the ‘strategy.’”

In the meantime, President Biden appears to be committed to continuing to bomb Yemen until the attacks in the Red Sea are halted.

When he was asked by a reporter if the airstrikes in Yemen were working, he replied tersely: “Well, when you say ‘working’ are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue?

A cluster of lost cities in the Amazon rainforest that was home to at least 10,000 farmers around 2,000 years has been uncovered by archeologists, who described the “incredible” find as an “extremely complicated society”.

Stéphen Rostain, first discovered a series of earthen mounds and buried roads in Ecuador - which have been mapped in 3D images - more than two decades ago but wasn’t sure what he had found at the time.

“I wasn’t sure how it all fit together,” Mr Rostain, one of the researchers who reported on the new finding published in the journal Science on Thursday, said.

The sites were found to be part of a dense network of settlements and connecting roadways that were tucked into the forested foothills of the Andes - the mountain range that runs from the top to the bottom of South America - that lasted about 1,000 years, laser-sensor technology mapping shows.

“It was a lost valley of cities,” said Rostain, who directs investigations at France’s National Center for Scientific Research. “It’s incredible.”

The settlements were occupied by the Upano people between around 500 B.C. and 300 to 600 A.D. — a period roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire in Europe, the researchers found.

Residential and ceremonial buildings erected on more than 6,000 earthen mounds were surrounded by agricultural fields with drainage canals. The largest roads were 33 feet (10 meters) wide and stretched for 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers).

While it’s difficult to estimate populations, the site was home to at least 10,000 inhabitants — and perhaps as many as 15,000 or 30,000 at its peak, said archaeologist Antoine Dorison, a study co-author at the same French institute. That’s comparable to the estimated population of Roman-era London, then Britain’s largest city.

“This shows a very dense occupation and an extremely complicated society,” said University of Florida archeologist Michael Heckenberger, who was not involved in the study. “For the region, it’s really in a class of its own in terms of how early it is.”

José Iriarte, a University of Exeter archaeologist, said it would have required an elaborate system of organized labor to build the roads and thousands of earthen mounds.

“The Incas and Mayans built with stone, but people in Amazonia didn’t usually have stone available to build — they built with mud. It’s still an immense amount of labor,” said Iriarte, who had no role in the research.

The Amazon is often thought of as a “pristine wilderness with only small groups of people. But recent discoveries have shown us how much more complex the past really is,” he said.

Scientists have recently also found evidence of intricate rainforest societies that predated European contact elsewhere in the Amazon, including in Bolivia and in Brazil.

“There’s always been an incredible diversity of people and settlements in the Amazon, not only one way to live,” said Rostain. “We’re just learning more about them.”",Resume214,[],2024-01-18 00:41:04+00:00,"['cities', 'amazon', 'sign', 'lost', 'rostain', 'verifyerrors', 'roads', 'earthen', 'email', 'valley', 'breaking', 'dense', 'settlements', 'hidden']",the_independent_articles

Watch as Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov attends a United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine after Russian officials claimed that Western-supplied weapons were used in an attack on Donetsk.

At least 27 people have been killed and 25 others have been wounded after shelling in the city, Moscow-installed officials said.

Local leader Denis Pushilin said two children were among those injured.

Russia has claimed that Western-supplied weapons were used in the attack at a market in Tekstilshchik on Sunday.

Kyiv did not immediately comment on the strike, but its Tavria army group later denied responsibility.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” according to a UN spokesperson.

The US is carrying out airstrikes in three countries across the Middle East. It has sent billions of dollars in military hardware and is providing tactical support for its closest ally in the region, which is embroiled in a war against one militant group and almost daily skirmishes with another on its northern border. US forces in two of those countries have been attacked more than 150 times in the last three months, and the de-facto ruling power in an impoverished country in the Red Sea has brought international shipping there to a grinding halt.

It was not announced with great ceremony, as previous American adventures in the Middle have been – in fact, it was not announced at all. But the US is now embroiled in a regional war against an alliance of Iran-backed militant groups spread from Syria to Yemen. That war is being conducted with little congressional oversight, and with little acknowledgement from the Biden administration of the scale of the fighting.

It is an outcome that the Biden administration has claimed to have worked hard to prevent, but analysts say that the president’s unconditional support of Israel’s war against Hamas, in retaliation for the Palestinian group’s attack on 7 October, has ignited a tinderbox that will be difficult to contain.

“Unfortunately, we are now deep into a regional war and all the parties involved have made the worst possible miscalculations,” says Thanassis Cambanis, senior fellow and director of Century International, who warned of such an eventuality in the early days of the Israel-Hamas war.

Indeed, the Biden administration’s two main priorities in the aftermath of the Hamas attack seemed incompatible from the start. Mr Biden promised unconditional support for Israel’s war in Gaza, and to prevent that conflict spiralling into a wider regional war. But Mr Cambanis argues it was precisely the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, and refusal to use its leverage to pressure Israel to end it, that fuelled the regional escalation.

The US military carried out further airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen on Tuesday, targeting what it characterised as anti-ship ballistic missiles.

The action followed dozens of strikes against the Iran-backed rebels across Yemen in recent days as the US and UK seek to halt attacks by the group on cargo ships in the Red Sea, which were launched in response to Israel’s war in Gaza.

Two US officials told Reuters that Tuesday’s strikes were targeted at four anti-ship missiles.

The US and UK airstrikes began on Friday, when more than 60 targets in 25 locations were hit. On Saturday, the Pentagon said a Tomahawk missile fired from the Navy destroyer USS Carney hit a Houthi radar site.

The strikes come as the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that two US Navy SEALs were lost at sea in a mission targeting Iranian weapons deliveries to the Houthis.

The night-time mission ended with the seizure of a small sailing boat that was transporting “advanced lethal aid” to the Houthis as part of the group’s “campaign of attacks against international merchant shipping,” the Pentagon said in a statement on Tuesday.

The SEALs had been reported missing in the days following the mission, which took place on 11 January, but its purpose had not been revealed. The two SEALs were still missing as of Tuesday morning.

An ancient tomb believed to be more than 4,000 years old has been discovered in Egypt.

A team of Egyptian and Japanese archaeologists in Saqqara found burials, architectural elements and other artefacts during the mission. Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities confirmed the find on Saturday.

Among the discoveries are the remains of a human buried with a coloured mask and a burial for a small child which are believed to date back to the Second Dynasty, according to Ahram Online. The tomb dates between 2649 and 2150 BC, experts say.

Other artefacts include a coffin from the 18th Dynasty (1550-1295 BC) containing a well-preserved alabaster vessel. Burials from the Ptolemaic eras were also uncovered.

Two terracotta statues depicting the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis, a deity initially prominent in funerary practices, and the child deity Harpocrates, the god of silence and secrets in the Ptolemaic periods were also discovered.

Various amulets, pottery models and ostraca, which are pieces of broken pottery, featuring hieratic inscriptions (cursive scripts used in ancient Egypt) were also found among the trove of discoveries according to Ahram.

In a Facebook post, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said: “The joint Egyptian-Japanese archaeological mission between the Supreme Council of Archaeology and Waseda University has succeeded in uncovering a rock tomb from the Second Dynasty, a number of architectural elements, burials and archaeological finds in the Saqara region.

“The mission has carried out recording and archaeological documentation of all the archaeological finds found this season.

“The joint Egyptian-Japanese archaeological mission between the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Waseda University succeeded in uncovering a rock tomb dated to Dynasty 2, along with a number of architectural features, burials, and archaeological finds at the Saqqara archaeological site.

“The mission carried out archaeological recording and documentation of all archaeological discoveries found during their work season.”

The discovery “provides invaluable insights into the history of this region,” Nozomu Kawai, head of the Japanese team, told Ahram.

Mustafa Waziri, the SCA’s secretary-general, said: “The artefacts and burials uncovered provide a window into the lives of those who lived in this ancient civilization.”",Resume221,[],2024-01-17 00:19:43+00:00,"['egyptian', 'finds', 'tomb', 'ancient', '4500yearold', 'verifyerrors', 'mission', 'burials', 'archaeological', 'artefacts', 'saqqara', 'archaeologists', 'dynasty', 'uncover', 'team']",the_independent_articles

Justin Trudeau has said that if Donald Trump is re-elected as US president, it will not “be easy” for Canada.

The Canadian prime minister said that the former president returning to the White Housewould be a “step back” and a “victory of populism”, in remarks made on Tuesday.

It comes after Mr Trump – the clear GOP frontrunner – scored a decisive victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.

Many have speculated that the win puts him in good stead to secure the Republican nomination – taking him one step closer on his path back to the Oval Office.

Mr Trudeau, whose centre-left Liberals came to power in November 2015, had rocky relations with Mr Trump during his first four-year White House term. In 2018, the former president accused him of being weak and dishonest.

""It wasn’t easy the first time and if there is a second time, it won’t be easy either,"" Mr Trudeau said in French during a discussion hosted by the Montreal chamber of commerce.

""But we can’t imagine a day when it will ever be easy with the Americans. The main responsibility for any prime minister is to represent and defend Canada’s interests ... we’ve been able to do this very well these past few years.""

Canada sends 75% of its goods and services exports to the United States and is particularly vulnerable to any US shift toward protectionism.

According to Reutersin a survey this month, around two-thirds of Canadians surveyed said they did not think US democracy could survive another four years of Trump in power.

Around half said the US is on the way to becoming an authoritarian state, the poll, which was released on Monday, stated.

Mr Trudeau added that a win for Mr Trump would be ""a step back"" and a victory for ""a populism that reflects a lot of anguish and fury ... without necessarily providing solutions"".

He said that Mr Trump also had shown little interest in tackling climate change, in contrast to the Liberals, for whom it is a priority.

""There are clearly issues where I do not agree at all with Mr. Trump,"" Mr Trudeau said, citing the climate question, per Reuters.

The remarks by the Canadian prime minister come shortly after a similar sentiment was shared by the president of the European Central Bank.

Last week, Christine Lagarde warned that the re-election of Mr Trump would be a threat to Europe.

In an interview with France 2 TV, she said the way Mr Trump conducted his first term as president was enough to raise concerns over his potential return to power.

“If we should learn lessons from history, from the way he led the first four years of his mandate, it is clearly a threat,” Ms Lagarde said during the interview.

“It’s sufficient to look at the trade tariffs, the commitment to Nato, the fight against climate change. In just these three areas, in the past [under Trump], US interests were not aligned with European interests.”

Observers said Ms Lagarde’s comments marked a departure from the customary practice of central bank’s leaders to avoid involvement in political matters.

Two US Navy SEALs were lost at sea on a mission targeting Iranian weapons deliveries to Houthis in Yemen, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The night-time mission ended with the seizure of a small sailing boat that was transporting “advanced lethal aid” to the Yemeni rebel group as part of its “campaign of attacks against international merchant shipping,” the Pentagon said in a statement.

The SEALs had been reported missing in the days following the mission, which took place on 11 January off the coast of Somalia, but its purpose had not been revealed. The two SEALs were still lost at sea as of Tuesday morning.

US officials told the Associated Press this weekend that the SEALs were on an interdiction mission, and were climbing up onto the vessel when one was knocked off by high waves. The second SEAL then jumped in after the first, following protocol.

“We are conducting an exhaustive search for our missing teammates,” said General Michael Erik Kurilla, USCENTCOM Commander.

Houthi forces in Yemen, which are backed by Iran, have conducted regular attacks on cargo ships and fired missiles towards US Navy vessels in the Red Sea in recent months in response to Israel’s war in Gaza.

The US and the UK responded to the attacks with dozens of airstrikes across Yemen aimed at deterring the Houthis. The Pentagon said the mission last week was the first time it had seized Iranian-supplied, advanced conventional weapons on their way to the Houthis since the attacks on shipping began in November.

A team of Navy SEALs operating from the USS Lewis B Puller were supported by helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles in the mission to seize the vessel.

The Pentagon said the shipment included “propulsion, guidance, and warheads for Houthi medium range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), as well as air defense associated components.”

It added that those same weapons had been used by the Houthis to attack international merchant ships passing through the Red Sea.

General Kurilla said the weapons deliveries were “yet another example of how Iran actively sows instability throughout the region in direct violation of UN Security Resolution 2216 and International law.”

A manhunt has been launched after a worker fell into an enormous crack created by the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in Iceland.

The missing man was working to fill in crevasses formed by earthquakes and volcanic activity in the fishing town of Grindavik when he fell on Wednesday, according to local media.

The search, involving hundreds of rescue workers, had to be called off overnight on Thursday after landslides dropped tonnes of rocks on the area.

“At midnight, we had to stop the search because we could not guarantee the safety of those who were working down in the crevasse,” Ulfar Ludviksson, the police chief in South Iceland said. “There was a rockfall at the top.”

“It’s deep down. This runs tens of metres down to the bottom. There is water far below this work area where rescuers are working,” he said.

“There are two men who go down in a basket and stay down for about 10 minutes. Then they come up and the other two take over.”

The missing man was being lowered to work on filling cracks in town with soil and compacting before he fell.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by the conditions and the fact that the tight gap only fit two people at the time to look for him.

“What is absolutely clear is that we are sending people into life-threatening situations, so we have to spend more time on the safety of those who are going to work on this,” field manager Hjálmar Hallgrímsson told local outlet RUV.

“People are clambering around this and trying to get to it, and the work area is for two people, we can’t get more people in.

“That is why we are replacing people and bringing in fresh hands. These are the conditions we are trying to work with.”

Mayor of Grindavik Fannar Jónasson says that the accident took “everyone by surprise” and shows how serious the cracks in the town which was evacuated in November.

Armed militia stormed a television studio during a live broadcast in Ecuador carrying shotguns, pistols, and homemade bombs, after the country’s president issued a decree declaring 22 gangs as terrorist organisations.

Police arrested 13 gunmen who took over television station TC in the city of Guayaquil during a live broadcast on Tuesday, forcing staff onto the floor in footage beamed to thousands of homes.

The channel, which was back on-air for its evening news broadcast, said two employees were injured in the incident.

The terrified host was seen praying to the camera as a shotgun was held to his head, while other attackers showed off grenades and sticks of dynamite to the audience. The group shouted that they had bombs as what sounded like gunshots were heard in the background.

The newspaper El Universo said reporters on the interrupted El noticiero news programme messaged groups begging for help. One read: “They want to kill the lot of us. Help us.” The channel broadcast live for at least 15 minutes before the signal was cut off. During the transmission, someone was heard yelling: “Don’t shoot!”

Alina Manrique, the head of news for TC Television, said she was in the control room, across from the studio, when the group of masked men entered the building. One of the men pointed a gun at her head and told her to get on the floor, Manrique said.

“I am still in shock,” Manrique said in a phone interview. “Everything has collapsed .... All I know is that it’s time to leave this country and go very far away.”

Some of the assailants ran from the studio and tried to hide elsewhere in the building when they realised they were surrounded by the police, she said.

Half an hour after the gang stormed onto the set, police entered the building and later announced a number of arrests had been made. Police in Guayaquil confirmed 13 arrests and social media posts showed photos of young men lying on the floor with their hands zip-tied behind their backs.

Ecuador Police said on Twitter/X they had managed to release the hostages. Local media outlets have also reported armed factions entering the Maldonado Hospital and the University of Guayaquil.

The incident followed the kidnappings of at least seven police officers and a series of explosions, a day after president Daniel Noboa declared a state of emergency.

Mr Noboa issued a 60-day state of emergency on Monday, after a convicted gang leader disappeared from his prison cell, giving authorities the ability to suspend rights and mobilise the military in places like prisons.

In the southern city of Machala, Quito, and Los Rios seven police officers were kidnapped in three separate incidents. Three officers taken in Machala were later freed and 10 arrests were made, the police said.

Explosions were reported in Esmeraldas and Los Rios as the attorney general’s office said it was investigating one in Guayaquil. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosions so far.

The crisis developed after the leader of Los Choneros gang Adolfo Macías, known as “Fito”, vanished from his cell, with authorities unable to find him or explain his disappearance. Ecuador’s prosecutors office tweeted on Monday that it had filed charges against two prison guards as part of the investigation into the case which it is considering a “prisoner’s escape”.

Los Choneros is one of the Ecuadorian gangs considered by authorities as responsible for a spike in violence over the past years that reached a new level last year with the assassination of the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The gang has links with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, according to authorities.

The politician had said that the criminal group led by Fito threatened him, but so far authorities haven’t directly accused Macías or his group of being behind Villavicencio’s murder.

Los Choneros and other similar groups linked to Mexican and Colombian cartels are fighting over drug trafficking routes and control of territory, including from within detention facilities, where at least 400 inmates have died since 2021, according to authorities.

Experts have acknowledged that gang members practically rule from inside the prisons, and Macías is believed to have kept controlling his group from within the detention facility.

President Noboa, an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, took over in November saying his government’s main objective is to reduce violence.

His administration said the violence was a reaction to the president’s plan to build a new high-security prison and transfer jailed gang leaders.

“Today’s events show that the actions and decisions taken by the national government are gravely affecting criminal structures, and as an answer they have created a wave of violence to frighten the populace,” Admiral Jaime Vela, head of the joint command of the armed forces, said after a security meeting with the president.

The US condemned Tuesday's ""brazen attacks"", saying Washington was closely coordinating with president Noboa and stands ready to assist. Brazil, Colombia and Chile in the neighbourhood extended their support for the Ecuadorian government.

Ecuador’s domestic crisis prompted Peru's government to declare an emergency in the north along its border with Ecuador.

Thrillseekers found themselves stuck at the top of one of the tallest rollercoasters in the world for several hours after a scarf became stuck on coaster wheels.

Passengers were evacuated from the DC Rivals HyperCoaster at the Warner Bros Movie World theme park on Australia’s Gold Coast on Friday.

The 200ft ride is described as the “tallest, longest and fastest in the Southern Hemisphere”, and stopped just as it was about to reach one of the highest points of the track.

Horrified theme-park goers looked on as passengers on board were evacuated (@deahotcakes/Instagram)

Dramatic footage showed the ride halted at 3pm local time Friday (4am GMT) after a scarf became entangled around the train wheel.

In their latest update Warner Bros Movie World said they had finally evacuated all passengers from the ride after a dramatic three-hour rescue.

“Our highly-trained ride operators identified a loose item (scarf) that had become entangled around the train wheel of the DC Rivals HyperCoaster and used their ride control system to safely stop the ride on the lift hill as a precaution,” their statement read.

Staff were seen wearing harnesses on the track assisting passengers in their evacuation (@deahotcakes/Instagram)

“The ride operator and the ride’s safety systems have done what they are trained and designed to do, and all the guests on-board are safe with the ride vehicle stopped in a designated zone.

“Our team exited the guests down the lift hill which is a process we regularly train for and simply requires the guests to walk down the stairs to the load station. Due to the height of the lift hill, we provided a harness for the guests.”

They added that as the park was closing at the time the last guests were exited, the ride won’t reopen until tomorrow as normal. Movie World said they understand ride stoppages can be frustrating, but reminded guests to remember safety rules.

They said: “We understand ride stoppages can be frustrating for guests and it is for reasons such as these why loose items are not permitted to be taken on-board rides and attractions and we encourage guests to follow all instructions of our operators.”",Resume232,[],2024-01-05 09:23:21+00:00,"['trapped', 'rollercoaster', 'worlds', 'guests', 'sign', 'largest', 'left', 'verifyerrors', 'scarf', 'ride', 'world', 'movie', 'lift', 'loose', 'train', 'passengers']",the_independent_articles

Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official and founding member of the organisation’s military wing, has been killed in an explosion in a Beirut suburb that raises fresh fears the Israel-Gaza conflict could escalate.

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said four people died in a blast carried out by an Israeli drone in Musharafieh on Tuesday. Now officials say Mr Arouri was among them.

Hezbollah leader Syed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to retaliate against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon. Mr Arouri led Hamas’s presence in the West Bank. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill Mr Arouri in August 2023, before the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly three months ago.

In late October, Mr Arouri met with Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Islamic Jihad’s leader Ziad al-Nakhalah to discuss the next steps in the war, but few details emerged about their conversation. It was the first meeting of its kind to be publicly reported since the beginning of the war.

Last month, Mr Arouri told Al Jazeera TV Hamas would not exchange any prisoners until there was a ceasefire in Gaza and all Palestinians detained in Israel were released.

The latest Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October when Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel. The Gaza Health Ministry says 22,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing conflict. As of 22 November, two-thirds of those killed in Gaza were women in children, according to the United Nations.

Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed and 240 were taken hostage in the initial assault. Israeli officials believe 129 hostages are still in Gaza.

The United States vetoed a UN resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza last month. Nearly all other members of the UN Security Council supported the resolution.

Also in December, US president Joe Biden bypassed Congress twice to send a combined $253m (£200m) in military equipment to Israel.

Mr Biden’s response to the conflict thus far has proven particularly unpopular among younger voters.",Resume233,[],2024-01-02 19:59:08+00:00,"['suburb', 'conflict', 'gaza', 'sign', 'leader', 'hamas', 'verifyerrors', 'official', 'beirut', 'officials', 'arouri', 'israeli', 'mr', 'killed', 'saleh']",the_independent_articles

Berlin police detained over 300 people on New Year’s Eve after at least 14 on-duty officers were injured as people shot fireworks at each other and police throughout the city.

One of the incidents occurred near Alexanderplatz where around 500 people were letting off fireworks at each other before police dispersed the group at the landmark Neptune Fountain, reported DW.

The crowd fired at police with pyrotechnics when they tried to check them for fireworks, according to the outlet.

In Neukölln, a number of arrests were made after people attempted to make Molotov cocktails, which police say they confiscated.

While others fled the earthquake that split the streets of an Icelandic town, one man refused to comply with police orders to evacuate, even in the face of a volcanic eruption.

Ólaf Benedikt Arnberg Þórðarson, 72, has lived in the quiet, Icelandic fishing port of Grindavik since 1968. The whole town was ordered to evacuate in November after the region was hit with hundreds of tremors.

The former sea captain and his wife began staying overnight in the weeks that followed so they could refurbish Hotel Grindavik and their Brúin restaurant for when the tourists eventually return.

But mere hours before the volcano finally erupted on Monday, 18 December two policewomen spotted Mr Þórðarson and presented him with an arrest warrant if he did not leave the town.

“ I told them I wasn’t going anywhere,” Mr Þórðarson told The Independent. ""They were polite, but they started to get more annoyed.

“As she [the police officer] put on leather gloves and threatened me with arrest, she said, ‘We’re leaving now, but we’ll be back’.”

The hotelier claims the police told him other locals would be barred from returning to Grindavik if he did not comply.

“So we just left’, he said. “The police chased us east with flashing lights after us. It was just so ridiculous.”

Mr Þórðarson was fortunate because that night lava of around 1,200 degrees Celsius began pouring out of a fissure about 4 kilometres long.

The Icelandic Meteorological Office estimated that hundreds of cubic metres of lava per second flowed out in the first two hours though fortunately it flowed north away from Grindavik.

Just three days after the eruption Mr Þórðarson insists he wants the town to reopen, attracting media attention and becoming a local folk hero for defying state orders.

“I didn’t want to leave,” he says on a break from trying to revitalise his hotel in town. “This government is crazy. I have a factory here, my family live here.

“We have this volcano now but I’m not worried about it. The whole of Iceland could erupt at any time and most of the earthquakes have stopped now.

“I think people will return but if my neighbours get settled for a long time in other towns they will never come home.”

The 4,000 residents were first evacuated when earthquakes began in November, and have been left in limbo ever since - some dreaming of a Christmas back home. But this was ruled out by officials forcing locals to celebrate the holidays as best they could elsewhere.

“I want to say ‘Look everybody it is ok’,” the former fishing captain said. “This is my hometown, it’s a beautiful day yet we cannot stay.”

“I know so many people who want to rebuild and make Grindavik even better,” he continued. Grindavik doesn’t need any help it just needs people back. We need normal thinking from the government.

“People are always asking why there are no people here. There is no lava here. We are very pleased the lava turns to rock quickly and we are safe.”

Visitors are now allowed into the town at 7am but are still under strict orders to evacuate again by 4pm.

Úlfar Lúðvíksson, police chief in the region, said: “Many things have changed in the eruption area. Watching the eruption today is completely different than on Monday night. There have been changes there, hopefully positive.”

After numerous postponed votes, the United Nations Security Council on Friday approved a resolution calling for urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, abandoning a proposal that would have urged for a broader ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed over 20,000 people and devastated large parts of the Gaza Strip.

That’s despite worldwide protests and a UN General Assembly majority vote last week calling for such a pause in fighting.

So what does the resolution do? Here’s what you need to know:

Expanded aid, and vague hopes of peace

The resolution calls for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access and to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.”

The final language is a step back from the original text in the United Arab Emirates-proposed resolution, which demanded an “urgent suspension of hostilities.”

A vote on the resolution was scheduled for Monday, but was delayed every day this week as the US pushed for revisions behind the scenes.

After more than a week of negotiations between the UAE, the US, which has crucial veto power over the UNSC, and other nations, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday that negotiators reached compromise language that the US and Israel could support.

Earlier this month, the US, a staunch ally of Israel in the conflict, vetoed a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

The final resolution also scaled down a proposal to have the UN “exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes,” instead calling for the body to appoint an official responsible for helping coordinate aid.

A dire reality in the conflict zone

The resolution is notable in that it contains the Security Council’s first agreed-upon reference to some future pause in fighting, though it’s unlikely to provide much hope to those in the war zone.

The day before the vote, a UN-backed food monitoring body found that Gaza’s entire population of over 2.2m people are approaching famine conditions.

“These are not just numbers — there are individual children, women and men behind these alarming statistics,” World Food Program chief economist Arif Husain said in a statement. “The complexity, magnitude and speed that this crisis has unfolded is unprecedented.”

The Israeli campign has killed roughly 1 per cent of the population of Gaza, and more than two-thirds of those killed in the response to the brutal 7 October Hamas attack have been women and children.

An estimated 85 per cent of Gaza’s population has been internally displaced, according to the UnitedNations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights.

Thus far, only a weeklong temporary ceasefire at the end of November has paused the fighting, allowing aid to trickle into Gaza as both Israel and Hamas exchanged detainees held in their custody.

US officials have said they support temporary “humanitarian pauses” in the conflict, rather than urging for a full-in ceasefire, a stance that human rights groups and nations critical of the US have argued amounts to being complicit in war crimes.

Mixed reaction from world leaders

The resolution, which passed 13-0 with abstentions from Russia and the US, was greeted with a mix of world opinion.

Russia abstained in protest, arguing the resolution would allow Israel to continue a ground invasion of Gaza that has carried a vast civilian death toll.

“By signing off on this the Council would essentially be giving the Israeli armed forces complete freedom of movement for furthering clearing of the Gaza Strip, and anyone voting for the text as it is currently worded would bear responsibility for that,” Russian Ambassador Vassily A Nebenzia told the UN chamber on Friday.

The UAE’s Lanna Nusseibeh, meanwhile, defended the proposal, while voicing larger criticisms of Israel’s policy towards Palestine.

“The text compels the international community to finally share in the burden that Egypt has been shouldering and it commits all of us to breaking the cruel blockades strangling Gaza for the last 16 years,” she said after the vote.

“The injustice of the occupation persists with the international community’s complicity. If you have a moral, national or political interest in saving the two-state solution, you must act now. This resolution gives us an opportunity to demonstrate that at the very least, the world will not tolerate the continued deprivation of the people of Gaza from basic necessities,” she added.

Israel, meanwhile, called the resolution “unnecessary.”

“In our view, the resolution is unnecessary and proves the inability for the UN to play a positive role in the conflict. After nearly three months, the UN has yet to condemn the massacre of October 7,” an Israeli official told CNN.",Resume239,[],2023-12-22 19:17:34+00:00,"['humanitarian', 'conflict', 'impact', 'wider', 'verifyerrors', 'israel', 'resolution', 'week', 'war', 'world', 'calling', 'breaking', 'gaza', 'uns', 'unlikely']",the_independent_articles

More than 120 people have been killed in China’s deadliest earthquake in over a decade, with 700 more injured.

The search continues for missing people as authorities said more than 155,000 homes in Gansu had been either damaged or destroyed in the powerful earthquake.

Emergency workers are in the process of preparing makeshift accommodation and meals to those who have been displaced by the disaster as thousands of residents are braced to spend the night in icy weather conditions.

The 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck at 11.59pm (4pm GMT) on Monday night at a shallow depth of 10km. Its epicentre centred in the mountainous region of Gansu province in northwestern China, also affecting neighbouring Qinghai according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre.

It was followed by a second 5.5 magnitude earthquake hours later in neighbouring Xinjiang.

In Gansu, 113 were killed as of 1pm Tuesday (5am GMT) and 536 were injured according to Chinese authorities. The death tally in Qinghai rose to at least 13 with 182 injured.

Officials said the search for 20 missing people is continuing.

Icy weather conditions have shortened the “golden window” to find quake survivors, Shi Wanjin, a captain of the Gansu Houtian Emergency Rescue Corps, said.

President Xi Jinping said “all efforts should be made to carry out search and rescue, treat the injured in a timely manner, and minimise casualties”.

China’s finance ministry and emergency management ministry jointly allocated 200m yuan (£22.1m) for the earthquake-hit Gansu and Qinghai provinces, CCTV reported.

Two Chinese balloons flew north of Taiwan, the island's Defense Ministry said Monday, as China increases pressure on the self-ruled territory it claims as its own ahead of a presidential election in January.

The balloons crossed the sensitive Taiwan Strait separating the island from China and were detected about 110 nautical miles (204 kilometers) northwest of the northern port city of Keelung on Sunday, the ministry said.

It was the second time this month that Taiwan reported a Chinese balloon near its territory after one crossed southwest of Keelung on 7 December.

At the time the ministry said the balloon passed Keelung and then continued east before disappearing, possibly into the Pacific Ocean.

There seemed to be some uncertainty about whether the balloon was operated by the People’s Liberation Army, the military branch of China’s ruling Communist Party.

The ministry referred to it both as a “PLA surveillance balloon” and as “PRC’s balloon,” using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China, China’s official name.

China’s potential for using weather balloons to spy on other governments came into focus earlier this year, when the United States shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, drawing China’s ire.

The balloon was suspected of having conducted spying activities on the US military.

At the time President Joe Biden said that he “ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down...as soon as possible”.

He said that military leaders chose to wait until the balloon was above water as it was “the safest place to do it”.

“They successfully took it down and I want to complement our aviators who did it,” he added.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry did not say whether it suspected the latest balloon could have been used for spying.

China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment, according to AP News.

Beijing has increased pressure on Taiwan by sending military aircraft and warships near the island almost daily.

Taipei is preparing for a presidential election on 13 January.

The front-runner, current Vice President William Lai of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has been criticized by Beijing as a “separatist.”

Lai has said he wants to maintain peace and the status quo in relations with China.

The director of the Miss Nicaragua pageant, Karen Celebertti, on Monday announced her retirement from the organization, nine days after the Nicaraguan police accused her of “conspiracy” and other crimes along with her husband and son, who are detained.

“The time has come for my retirement,” Celebertti wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I know that there will always be more opportunities for us.”

It was Celebertti’s first public statement after the scandal that followed the coronation of Sheynnis Palacios as Miss Universe on Nov. 18 in El Salvador.

The businesswoman said that she worked for 23 years “with zeal and effort” until Nicaragua won the world beauty crown this year, which she described “as an achievement for everyone” and “for every Nicaraguan, without political distinction.”

Palacios’ surprise victory in the contest unleashed demonstrations of joy in the streets of Nicaragua, prompting criticism by the government of Daniel Ortega.

According to the local press, immigration authorities prevented Celebertti and her daughter Luciana from entering the country on Nov. 22, after they attended Palacios’ coronation and accompanied her on a short trip to Mexico.

Later it was announced that the police raided Celebertti's home in the southwest of Managua and arrested her husband, Martín Argüello, and their son, Bernardo.

Without confirming the arrest, the authorities accused the three members of the Argüello Celebertti family on Dec. 2 of the crimes of treason, conspiracy and “organized crime.”

A statement by the National Police claimed Celebertti “participated actively, on the internet and in the streets in the terrorist actions of a failed coup,” an apparent reference to the 2018 protests.",Resume243,[],2023-12-12 14:35:17+00:00,"['director', 'sign', 'statement', 'miss', 'verifyerrors', 'email', 'streets', 'nicaragua', 'rocks', 'pageant', 'investigated', 'celebertti', 'breaking', 'son', 'scandal', 'valid']",the_independent_articles

Watch as the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded at the Oslo City Hall on Sunday 10 December.

This year’s laurate, Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, is in jail in Iran.

She will be represented by her children Ali and Kiana Rahmani and husband Taghi Rahmani.

They are expected to deliver her speech, sharing the message of a mother of whom they are fiercely proud but who they have not seen for almost nine years.

“We are not nervous, we are very proud to be able to be the voice of our mother and do our best to move things forward. The prize will reinforce our determination to go to the end,” Ali said, ahead of the ceremony.

Ms Mohammadi will go on a new hunger strike from her prison cell as the prize is awarded in Oslo in her absence, her family said Saturday.

“She said ‘I will start my hunger strike on the day that I am being granted this prize, perhaps then the world will hear more about it,’” her husband, Taghi Rahmani, said.",Resume244,[],2023-12-10 11:47:04+00:00,"['awarded', 'watch', 'email', 'strike', 'oslo', 'sign', 'absence', 'despite', 'peace', 'prize', 'verifyerrors', 'jailed', 'proud', 'nobel', 'breaking', 'rahmani', 'winner', 'taghi', 'valid']",the_independent_articles

A coroner in New Zealand has issued a warning to women on the contraceptive pill and doctors prescribing it, after two women died just 10 days apart from similar complications.

By releasing findings into the tragedies, Coroner Alex Ho in Auckland recommended that women should be counselled on the risks of venous thromboembolism, after both women developed unknown clotting conditions.

Georgia O’Neill, a 24-year-old makeup artist, had texted her flatmate and father to say she had a pain in her lower back and left leg which had left her wanting to throw up. She was later found dead in her room at her shared flat in September 2021.

It later emerged she had been unaware she had a condition known as Factor V Leiden mutation, with the pill increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) by 35 times.

In his recommendations, coroner Ho said that all women who take the combined contraceptive pill, in particular those with a family history of venous thromboembolism, should be vigilant for symptoms.

He added that women should be properly counselled on the increased risk and symptoms before being prescribed the pill.

Another woman, Isabella Rangiamohia Alexander, 17, also died in the same month after collapsing during a walk with her father. She was rushed to Auckland Hospital but died shortly after, with blood clots found on her legs and lungs.

Symptoms in the case of PE include chest pain under the ribcage, rapid breathing, dizziness and passing out. In the case of DVT, they include leg pain in the thig or calf, skin that is hot or has reddish discolouration or streaks and swelling.",Resume246,[],2023-11-29 15:58:34+00:00,"['died', 'sign', 'pill', 'verifyerrors', 'warning', 'contraceptive', 'zealand', 'coroner', 'deaths', 'breaking', 'issued', 'email', 'women', 'pain', 'later']",the_independent_articles

The US will review its decision to remove the Houthi rebel group from its list of designated terror organisations following the capture of an Israeli-linked ship over the weekend, the White House has announced.

The Iran-backed Yemeni group took control of the Galaxy Leader vessel in the southern Red Sea on Sunday and is holding its 25 crew members hostage.

The ship is believed to be associated with Ray Car Carriers, a company founded by Abraham Ungar, who is known as one of the richest people in Israel.

“In light of the recent targeting of civilians by the Houthis, and now the piracy of a ship in international waters, we have begun a review of potential terrorist designations and we’ll be considering other options together with our allies and partners as well,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reports on Tuesday.

Mr Kirby added that Iran was“complicit in its material support, and encouragement of the Houthi forces” and called on the group to “unconditionally” release the ship and its crew.

Joe Biden lifted the designation of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as a global terrorist organisation in 2021 in one of his first acts as president. The group was added to the list by the Trump administration in its final month in power.

Critics of the terror designation argued that it devastated aid and fuel shipments in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, which has often been described as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.

Yemen’s Houthis released video footage on Monday showing the capture of the ship. In it, armed men dropped from a helicopter and took hostages at gunpoint. The group said in a statement that the hijacking was in retaliation to Israel’s campaign war in Gaza.

“All ships belonging to the Israeli enemy or that deal with it will become legitimate targets,” the Houthis said.

A new study has revealed a shocking proportion of Australian men would abuse children “if no one found out”.

The research, conducted by the University of New South Wales, found “concerning” patterns, including that one in six Australian men said they had feelings for children under the age of 18, with 48 per cent of those answering being aged over 54.

One in 15 men questioned admitted they would have sexual contact with a child under the age of 14 if “no one found out”, while one in 25 said the same about children under 10.

The odds of a respondent saying they would have had sex with someone under the age of 18 was 10 times higher if they were aged over 65.

The survey, which questioned over 1900 men aged between 18 and 65 years old, is the world’s largest child sexual abuse perpetration prevention survey of its kind.

The study was welcomed by those who say that the common nature of sexual violence against women needs to be studied at the perpetrator level as well as with victims.

“The prevalence of abuse revealed in this report is deeply concerning,” Georgia Naldrett, manager of Jesuit Social Services’ Stop it Now! Australia service said.

“Our detailed and evidence-based recommendations call for investment in initiatives that address concerning behaviour before it starts, intervene earlier with boys and men who report troubling thoughts and behaviours, and reduce the reoffending risk of those who have already sexually abused children. Investment in these areas can help keep children safe from harm.”

The report found that 3 per cent of respondents had had sexual contact with a child. Researchers stated that over 95 per cent of those who answered “yes” to the question “have you had sex with someone under the age of 18 while over the age of 18?” were older than 24. The age of consent in Australia is 16.

Those who said they had sexual inclinations towards children and teenagers were more likely to be married, be higher income earners, with good social support as well and were more likely to be working with children.

One in 10 admitted to sexually abusing a child under the age of 18, including through accessing online pornography with underage children.

Online behaviours were also identified, with those most attracted to children and teenagers twice as likely to own cryptocurrency, spend time online, and be interested in watching violent porn and bestiality.

However, research also indicated that they were more likely to be victims of sexual abuse themselves or have had traumatic childhood experiences.

Jeff Merkley has become the second US senator to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Merkley, a Democrat representing Oregon, said in a statement released on Monday that he came to his decision after “many Americans, including thousands of Oregonians, have raised their voices to say more must be done to stop the carnage.”

“I am calling for a ceasefire—a cessation of hostilities by both sides. To endure, the ceasefire and the following negotiations must accomplish other essential objectives, including the release of all hostages and a massive influx of humanitarian aid,” he said.

Senator Merkley joins Dick Durbin, a Democrat representing Illinois, to become only the second lawmaker in the US Senate to call for a ceasefire, joining some 40 members of the House of Representatives.

Mr Merkley wrote that the ceasefire requires “an immediate cessation of military hostilities by both sides. But the ceasefire and the negotiations that follow must accomplish a number of objectives or it will not endure. “

“Hamas must release all the hostages without conditions and lay down their arms. And Hamas, which continues to defend the savage slaughter of Israeli citizens on October 7th and advocate for the obliteration of Israel, has to go. It can no longer have operational control of Gaza,” he added.

Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 12,700 Palestinians, including more than 5,000 children and 3,250 women, according to the Palestinian health ministry. In one month, Israeli forces have imposed a total siege of the densely packed territory, carried out relentless airstrikes and artillery, captured large parts of the northern half and cut off electricity and water to the 2.3 million people who live there.

Israel says the goal of the operation, which was launched in response to the massacre of 1,200 people by Hamas just over a month ago, is to destroy the group entirely.

As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened, calls for a ceasefire have grown. The United Nations secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has warned that Gaza was becoming a “graveyard for children”, and that “the unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour”.

But despite the high civilian death toll, only one US Senator had called for a ceasefire until Mr Merkley’s announcement.

Senate Majority Whip and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat representing Illinois, said he supported a ceasefire “at least in the context of both sides agreeing”.

“For example, the release of those who have been kidnapped should be part of this immediate release. That should be the beginning of it,” he told CNN.

Speaker Johnson says calls for Gaza ceasefire 'outrageous'

Mr Durbin has not pushed other Democrats to join him, however.

“They’re taking their own approach to it, I respect it,” he told The Independent. “It’s a complicated issue, tough call. I made my decision.”

The Independent emailed every US senator to ask their position on a ceasefire in Gaza; only 20 responded, and no one besides Mr Durbin supported a ceasefire. Where possible, The Independent’s reporters asked senators in person for their comments.

Of the remaining senators, 19 have called for a humanitarian pause — a position the Biden administration also supports. At least 11 senators have come out in opposition to a ceasefire, and the remainder did not respond to The Independent’s request for comment.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has continued to offer its unqualified support for Israel’s war, both practically and morally. President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve $14.3bn in aid for Israel in the wake of the Hamas attack, much of which would be spent on air and missile defence.

President Joe Biden has also faced calls for a ceasefire from his own staffers. Hundreds of government workers and members of Mr Biden’s own campaign team have pressed the administration to support a ceasefire.

One letter from more than 400 administration employees, including political appointees and White House staff, spans several cabinet-level agencies and the president’s office.

The letter, according to NBC News, calls on the president to “urgently demand a ceasefire” and “call for de-escalation of the current conflict by securing the immediate release of the Israeli hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians” as well as “the restoration of water, fuel, electricity and other basic services” and “the passage of adequate humanitarian aid to the Gaza strip.”",Resume249,[],2023-11-20 22:32:57+00:00,"['humanitarian', 'including', 'second', 'verifyerrors', 'hamas', 'durbin', 'ceasefire', 'support', 'merkley', 'israeli', 'gaza', 'senator', 'release', 'comes']",the_independent_articles
"Soup, salad and Peloton: What does it take to keep Biden on the road at 81?","Joe Biden is very much alive and running for re-election.” That was the message from the US president’s second-in-command, Kamala Harris, at the end of October. It wasn’t the most PR-savvy response to a question from a reporter asking what would happen “should something befall Biden and he’s not able to run”. But questions like this – which all centre on Biden’s age – have not only hounded him since he was elected in 2020, but are becoming increasingly frequent in the run-up to the next presidential election in 2024.

And it’s not out of left field. When Biden turned 80 last November he became the first octogenarian ever to serve as US president. On Monday 20 November, he’ll be 81. He’s already the oldest president in US history, and if he completes a second term in the Oval Office, he’ll be 86 when that term ends. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that 77 per cent of Americans say Biden is too old to run again. And like the passage of time, it’s an issue he can’t seem to escape.

So what does it look like to have an OAP in the White House, and what does it take to keep him on the road? And, more importantly, are we right to care?",Resume250,[],2023-11-20 07:08:42+00:00,"['road', 'run', 'term', 'unsurprising', '81', 'biden', 'wasnt', 'president', 'hell', 'does', 'hes', 'peloton', 'salad', 'soup', 'white']",the_independent_articles

Israel’s ambassador to the US has expressed hope that Hamas could release a significant number of hostages held in Gaza “in the coming days”, amid reports of talks that are also aimed at securing a days-long humanitarian pause in the conflict.

Declining to go into details of the “very sensitive” negotiations to free some of the estimated 240 captives seized in Hamas’s brutal cross-border incursion into Israel on 7 October, Michael Herzog told ABC’s This Week: “They are very serious efforts, and I’m hopeful we can have a deal in the coming days.”

Echoing the Israeli diplomat’s positive sentiments, White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said on Sunday that he believed a deal to free a considerable number of hostages could be closer than ever.

“What I can say at this point is that some of the outstanding areas of disagreement, in a very complicated, very sensitive negotiation, have been narrowed,” Mr Finer told NBC’s Meet the Press programme.

But he warned: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Sensitive negotiations like this can fall apart at the last minute.”

On Sunday, The Washington Post reported that a deal was imminent in which all parties would freeze combat operations for at least five days while 50 or more hostages were released in groups every 24 hours. However, US and Israeli officials denied the report.

It came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) chief said that 31 “very sick” premature babies had been safely transferred from al-Shifa Hospital – Gaza’s largest – more than a week after it was encircled and attacked by Israeli troops, who insist the hospital lies above an underground Hamas headquarters.

On Sunday night, the Israeli military published a video that it said showed a 55-metre fortified tunnel dug under the hospital.

While hundreds of patients and staff had already fled the hospital as food, water and medical supplies ran out, with all but five doctors remaining there on Saturday, international alarm had been growing over the fate of premature babies who had been left without incubators following a power blackout.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were evacuated in ambulances of the Palestinian Red Crescent to a hospital in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, where they were receiving urgent care before being moved to Egypt.

The babies were suffering from dehydration, vomiting and hypothermia, and some had sepsis because they hadn’t received any medication. They had not been in “suitable conditions for them to stay alive”, said Mohamed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Hamas-run Gaza.

A team of UN officials who visited the hospital on Saturday described it as a “death zone” and said 291 patients were still there, including the now rescued babies, trauma patients with severely infected wounds, and others with spinal injuries who were unable to move.

The WHO team reported signs of gunfire and shelling and a mass grave at al-Shifa’s entrance, and said they were making plans for the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients and staff, as evidenced by the babies’ departure on Sunday.

According to the health ministry, whose figures are deemed credible by the UN, more than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza – 5,000 of them children – since Israel’s intense retaliatory bombardment and subsequent invasion of the densely populated strip began on 7 October.

Witnesses reported heavy fighting overnight between Hamas gunmen and Israeli forces trying to advance into Jabaliya, Gaza’s largest refugee camp, where scores of people were feared to have been killed by Saturday’s alleged Israeli airstrike at a school where thousands were sheltering.

Israel’s military said on social media on Sunday that residents of several Jabaliya neighbourhoods should evacuate towards south Gaza “to preserve your safety”, and that it would pause military action from 10am to 2pm.

Once the pause had expired, 11 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabaliya, Gaza’s health ministry said.

Further south, Palestinian medics said 31 people were killed, including two local journalists, in airstrikes targeting houses in the Bureij and Nusseirat refugee camps on Saturday night. Another airstrike killed a woman and her child overnight in the southern city of Khan Younis, they said.

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said on Sunday that he was “deeply shocked” that two UN schools had been struck in less than 24 hours in Gaza, killing and injuring dozens of people “as they were seeking safety in United Nations premises”.",Resume251,[],2023-11-19 20:14:29+00:00,"['hospital', 'coming', 'number', 'israel', 'days', 'freed', 'verifyerrors', 'free', 'killed', 'premature', 'military', 'israeli', 'babies', 'gaza', 'patients', 'hostages', 'hopeful', 'significant']",the_independent_articles

President Joe Biden declared it was a “fact” that Hamas had “their headquarters, their military hidden under a hospital.” Senior White House officials said that the group was operating a “command-and-control node” in the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, citing US intelligence, and State Department officials referred to the hospital as being a Hamas “command centre.”

Those statements from the Biden administration this week, in response to questions about Israel’s military assault of Gaza’s largest hospital, appeared to qualify as tacit approval from the Biden administration for an operation that has been condemned by the United Nations and aid groups as a potential war crime.

Israel began what it described as a “precise and targeted” raid of al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday, which it has described as the “beating heart” of Hamas operations in northern Gaza. But after two days of searching the hospital grounds, the Israeli military has yet to produce any evidence to match those descriptions from the White House. Nor has Israel been able to prove their own claims that Hamas was operating from a sprawling underground layer beneath the hospital, which they had described in detail with maps and graphics .

Videos posted by the Israeli army on Wednesday showed a relatively scant haul from their initial search of the hospital grounds. In one clip , an Israeli soldier tours a room in the hospital and shows the camera what he describes as “a grab bag,” containing weapons and other military equipment, behind an MRI machine. The soldier finds another bag in another location during their search. The soldier displayed a total of 14 weapons , in addition to other military equipment, following the search. The Israeli army described the room as an “operational command center,” where they found “technological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by the Hamas terrorist organization.”

“These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital,” Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesperson said, adding that he believed the material was “just the tip of the iceberg” as troops continued to search for traces of the militants inside and beneath the facility.

On Thursday, Israel’s military announced they had found “an operational tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons,” at the hospital. It also said it had recovered the body of an Israeli woman near the hospital, one of around 240 hostages taken by Hamas gunmen when they stormed into southern Israel on 7 October.

But so far, Israel has not presented evidence that shows a large-scale headquarters under the hospital, although that may be forthcoming as the search of the hospital grounds continues.

In the meantime, that lack of evidence has raised questions for the Biden administration.

State Department spokesperson Matt Miller appeared to soften the administration’s language on the matter on Thursday, when asked whether al-Shifa was a legitimate target for a military assault.

“We never said there were command posts in every hospital in Gaza,” he told reporters. “We don’t want to see hospitals struck from the air. We understand that Hamas continues to use hospitals in places where they embed their fighters.”

When asked again if the US was certain al-Shifa hospital was a headquarters for Hamas, despite a lack of apparent evidence so far, Mr Miller responded: “I saw a host of rifles in videos. … I’m not aware that there’s a sort of acceptable threshold for assault rifles in hospitals. That’s not a general humanitarian practice.”

The Independent has asked the White House for comment on the al-Shifa raid.

The raid on al-Shifa hospital was preceded by at least four Israeli strikes on the facility, where thousands of Gaza residents had been sheltering, according to an investigation by the New York Times.

Israel had justified its attacks on al-Shifa with claims that Hamas had built an extensive network of tunnels and an underground headquarters beneath the hospital. Earlier this month, the Israeli army released what it described as an “intelligence-based illustration video” which showed a vast network of rooms and tunnels underneath the hospital that constituted the Hamas headquarters.

John Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, appeared to back up that assessment for a second time on Thursday, describing the intelligence as “definitive,” but refusing to share it publicly.

“We have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas was using al-Shifa as a command and control node, and most likely as well as a storage facility,” he said. “We are still convinced of the soundness of that intelligence.”

Mr Kirby said earlier in the week that “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them, to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages,” without providing any evidence.

He added, “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, PIJ, members operate a command-and-control node from al-Shifa in Gaza City. They have stored weapons there and they are prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility.”

Mr Biden’s comments on the facility came at a press conference on Wednesday evening alongside China’s president, Xi Jinping.

“You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military hidden under a hospital. And that’s a fact. That’s what’s happened,” he said in response to a question about whether the raid was justified.

“Israel did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did not rush everything down. They’ve gone in and they’ve gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns,” he added.

Hamas denied that it was using al-Shifa for military purposes in a statement on Thursday, describing them as “a blatantly false narrative.”

The raid on al-Shifa Hospital was condemned by the United Nations.

“I am appalled by reports of military raids at al-Shifa hospital,” the UN humanitarian agency chief, Martin Griffiths, said on X, formerly Twitter. “The protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns. Hospitals are not battlegrounds.”

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has reported that at least 521 people, including 16 medical workers, have been killed in 137 “attacks on health care” in Gaza.

WHO director Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that he was “extremely worried for the safety of staff and patients. Protecting them is paramount.”

“Even if health facilities are used for military purposes, the principles of distinction, precaution and proportionality always apply,” he added.

Dr Ahmed Makhalati, the head of al-Shifa’s burns unit, told The Independent on Wednesday that the Israeli army had taken over a section of the hospital complex.

“The soldiers are still inside the complex — they seem to be moving something inside the hospital complex but I can’t see properly as it’s too dangerous to take a look from the window. It’s a gamble to move between the buildings,” he said, as the sound of gunfire could be heard in the background.

“We are running out of fuel - it will be out by the end of the day — we don’t have food or water. We have lost 6 newborn babies in total — there are still 36 newborns here,” he said. The Independent has not been able to contact Dr Makhalati since.

All hospitals in Gaza have effectively been shut down since the war began after Israel cut off electricity and water and blocked deliveries of fuel, humanitarian aid and medicine from entering the territory, which is home to 2.3 million people.

The Israeli army will implement four-hour “pauses” in attacks along humanitarian corridors and in areas of active hostilities in northern Gaza to let civilians leave areas of hostilities, the White House has said.

National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday told reporters that pauses would be announced in advance by the IDF to give civilians notice of when it will be safe to move.

“We’ve been told by the Israelis that there will be no military operations in these areas over the duration of the pause, and that this process is starting today,” said Mr Kirby, who stressed that the decision to do so was Israel’s alone.

“Israel makes its’ own decisions. It’s fighting an enemy that is embedded in the civilian population, using hospitals and civilian infrastructure in an effort to shield itself from accountability and to place the innocent Palestinian people at greater risk,” he continued.

“At the same time, Israel has an obligation to fully comply with international law, and we believe these causes are a step in the right direction, particularly to help ensure that civilians have an opportunity to reach safer areas away from the act of fighting”.

Mr Kirby added that the development, which comes amid calls for what some have described as a humanitarian pause and others have described as a cease-fire, is the result of “recent discussions” between US and Israeli officials, including President Joe Biden’s most recent call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.

The National Security Council spokesperson’s remarks came just minutes after Mr Biden categorically rejected the idea of a cease-fire between Israeli and the Hamas militants it has been fighting since the 7 October terrorist attacks killed more than 1,300 Israelis and other civilians along the country’s border with Gaza.

Standing on the South Lawn just before he boarded Marine One to begin a trip to Illinois, the president told reporters there was “no possibility” of a cease-fire, which both US and Israeli officials have said would only benefit Hamas and allow the militant group to re-group and re-arm.

The president also said he was “still optimistic” about the chances of securing the release of the more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas.

When it was announced early last month, “Treasured Ornament: 10 Centuries of Islamic Art” promised an exhibit that evoked “the rich history of the Islamic world, and the shared human experiences that bind us, transcending borders and boundaries”.

The exhibit at the Frick Pittsburgh museum was set to open on 4 November. But, in the days after Hamas’s 7 October attacks in Israel, Israel’s siege of Gaza and a bombardment campaign that has killed thousands of Palestinians, the museum quietly decided to postpone the opening.

First, the museum blamed a “scheduling conflict” for the cancellation. But it followed up with a later announcement that linked the decision to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, explaining that “it would have been impossible to predict that war would erupt in the Middle East” during the show.

In a statement shared with The Independent, the museum said running the exhibit “risked trivialising Islamic culture at an extraordinarily complex time” and could be a source of “unintended insensitivity or offense” and a “distraction”. A statement two days later said the museum is “devastated to have hurt neighbors we deeply respect” with its announcement.

The Frick announcement and criticism surrounding it has joined a wider wave of censorship targeting pro-Palestinian and Muslim content in art institutions and media in the wake of Hamas attacks, including the cancellation of a museum event featuring a Palestinian artist in Ohio, the cancellation of a commissioned artwork in Manhattan that included a Palestinian flag, and the firing of a respected editor at Artforum, an international art magazine, after it published an open letter signed by thousands of artists demanding a ceasefire in Gaza.

‘A source of unintended insensitivity’

The Pittsburgh museum’s move alarmed civil rights groups and advocates who fear it wrongly conflates Islam with terrorism and antisemitism.

“This false perspective not only disregards the vast and diverse Islamic world that extends far beyond the Middle East but also undermines the essence of cultural diversity and appreciation that art represents,” according to Christine Mohamed, of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights group.

The group called for “reconsideration of this disturbing decision and encourage open dialogue between the various communities impacted.”

The exhibit included art from the 19th century or earlier, none of which referenced the current conflict or the humanitarian crisis.

But according to the museum, the exhibit “lacked sufficient historical and cultural context” as well as “participation from the regional Islamic community and others”. It said presenting the show risked “turning an intended educational opportunity into a divisive political touchstone, a source of unintended insensitivity or offense, and a distraction from our important service to the entire community.”

“It is simply wrong to suggest this decision was in any way political or reflects a singular viewpoint,” the museum added. West Virginia’s Huntington Museum of Art organised the exhibit, which is on tour with International Arts & Artists from Washington DC. Neither organization has yet responded to The Independent’s request for comment.

A decision to pull the exhibit also comes in the middle of the fifth anniversary of an antisemitic mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, in which 11 people were fatally shot during Shabbat services. Museum officials were not aware of any objections to the “Treasured Ornament” exhibit from Jewish organisations.

“Equating Islamic art and Muslims in general with Hamas is certainly bias[ed] and is certainly something we’re against,” Adam Hertzman, of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, told Pittsburgh’s NPR affiliate. “I believe that few people in the Jewish community would have been concerned about an exhibit on Islamic art because we understand that has nothing to do with Hamas, which is a terrorist organisation.”

Mr Hertzman told The Independent that the museum has “since spoken with them, and we understand from them that the exhibit had been postponed to allow time to give their staff training on how to respond in a sensitive way to questions or criticisms about the war in the Middle East.”

On 3 November, the museum announced that the exhibit will open in August 2024.

“The Frick is devastated to have hurt neighbors we deeply respect with our unclear communication about the postponement of this exhibition featuring 10 centuries of Islamic art,” the museum said in a statement shared with The Independent. “We will work earnestly to repair our relationships with the Muslim community.”

The museum “felt a responsibility to invest additional time to develop those partnerships” and “risked trivializing and objectifying Islamic culture as merely decorative” without them, the statement added.

‘His firing is unacceptable’

Artforum fired its editor David Velasco on 26 October after the publication of a letter with more than 8,000 signatories calling for “an end to the killing and harming of all civilians, an immediate ceasefire, the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the end of the complicity of our governing bodies in grave human rights violations and war crimes.” Artforum’s publishers determined that the letter failed to meet its editorial standards.

Shortly after Velasco was removed, senior editors Zack Hatfield and Chloe Wyma and editor Kate Sutton announced they were leaving the magazine.

“The firing of David Velasco violates everything I had cherished about the magazine and makes my work there untenable,” Ms Wyma wrote. Mr Hatfield said his firing “bodes ominously for the future of the magazine.”

Critics condemned the letter’s failure to mention the Hamas attack that killed 1,400, though an updated version of the statement repeated the signatories’ condemnation of “violence against all civilians, regardless of their identity” and expressed their “revulsion at the horrific massacres” of 7 October.

A group of gallerists and art dealers reportedly launched a pressure campaign to force some of the names on the open letter to retract their support.

One letter in response, from three influential artworld figures – Dominique Levy, Brett Gorvy and Amalia Dayan – condemned the open letter for its “one-sided view.” Another called the open letter “uninformed” and said it was “signed by artists who do not represent the artistic community at large”.

Mr Velasco and Penske Media Corporation, the publishing behemoth which owns Artforum,Variety and Rolling Stone, among more than a dozen other titles, have also been contacted for comment.

Jace Clayton, author of Uproot: Travels in 21st Century Music and Digital Culture, said he had pulled an upcoming piece from Artforum’s December issue after the “unacceptable” dismissal of Mr Velasco.

“By firing him, Penske Media sent a clear message that they don’t care about critical integrity. I got the message, and pulled my piece,” he told The Independent.

“The warning flags went up when Penske purchased the magazine last year,” he added. “Corporate consolidation has a chilling effect on cultural exchange and is intrinsically hostile towards any meaningful diversity.”

More than 300 people have since joined a boycott pledging to stop working with Penske titles following the “alleged interference with the editorial independence of Artforum”.

Among the writers and artists who signed the call for editorial independence after Mr Velasco’s termination: celebrated American photographer Nan Goldin.

“I have never lived through a more chilling period,” she told The New York Times. “People are being blacklisted. People are losing their jobs.”

‘A smear campaign ensued’

Palestinian artist Jumana Manna, who grew up in Jerusalem and now lives in Berlin, said she has already lost opportunities after a social media post about her solidarity with the Palestinian struggle was interpreted by others as her cheering on Israeli civilian deaths.

Ms Manna posted on her Instagram story the words “long live the creativity of resistance” over a photo shared by human rights activist Mona Seif of Hamas fighters paragliding into Israel on 7 October.

Her post was picked up by media outlets and social media accounts, with calls from institutions to boycott her.

In a column published in Hyperallergic on 1 November, she said her post, which she’d done before the full horrors of the attacks against civilians were clear, was taken out of context by “bad-faith” media outlets. “A smear campaign ensued, magnified by vindictive trolling that exaggerated and distorted my comments,” she added.

Ms Manna, who signed the open letter published in Artforum, was scheduled to speak on a panel at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University on 14 November. The museum’s discussions around “The Creative Future of Food” has now been cancelled.

“Given the expectation that the dialogue would include discussion of a region of the world that is now experiencing war, we did not feel it is an appropriate time to have a conversation about food sustainability with panelists who have expertise on this topic,” according to a statement from a Wexler spokesperson provided to The Independent.

Several art collectors reportedly pushed Wexner to shut down the exhibit entirely. Her exhibit “Break, Take, Erase, Tally” – currently on display at Wexner – includes her 2022 film Foragers, which explores the Palestinian practice of foraging wild plants. Wexler confirmed that Ms Manna’s exhibit will remain open through 30 December.

“International institutions that have worked with me in the past or present are being harassed and pressured,” she wrote in Hyperallergic, pointing to cancellations and pressure surrounding exhibits and artists who voiced support for Palestinians during Israel’s bombardments.

“I am not the only one,” Ms Manna added. “Across Europe and the United States, numerous cultural workers who identify with the Palestinian struggle have been systematically targeted, publicly defamed, sacked, or disinvited in what can only be described as an embargo on empathy for Palestinians.”

The list is stark in its simplicity: the victim’s name, age and sex. But great tragedies are inferred from within the margins of the more than 200 pages. It tells of entire families extinguished — infants, grandparents, mothers, uncles, cousins all sharing the same surname are grouped together. Lives cut short before they are even a year old. There are 6,747 names in total, all of them killed during Israel’s assault on Gaza.

That number, reached in just 19 days, does not include the missing, making the true toll likely higher still.

The decision by the health ministry in Gaza to release the names of the dead appears to have come in response to comments from president Joe Biden, who abruptly declared during a press conference on Wednesday that he had “no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using” to count their dead.

Those comments sparked immediate anger and questions, both in the US and further afield, about how the president came to his position of doubt. Mr Biden’s comments represented a departure from his administration’s previous position on the ministry, given that the State Department has used those same casualty figures in its own reports .

The United Nations and numerous nongovernmental organisations working in Gaza have also testified to their reliability.

Mr Biden’s comments followed one of the bloodiest 24 hours since Israel began bombing the densely populated Gaza Strip: 704 Palestinians, including 305 children, were killed, according to the health ministry.

Palestinian officials described Gaza’s hospitals as being in “a state of complete collapse” as a result of Israel’s war on Gaza, which was launched in response to the massacre of 1,400 people, most of them civilians, by Hamas during an incursion into southern Israel.

Reacting to the president’s comments, Medhat Abbas, the director of Gaza’s largest hospital al-Shifa, told The Independent that he believed Mr Biden “does not know the truth.”

“He decides according to false news,” Mr Abbas said. “The ministry of health have released the names and ID for him to know the reality, but he is determined to ignore the truth.”

Mr Biden did not elaborate on what shaped his view of the ministry’s figures, but organisations with experience working in Gaza have used the numbers for many years. Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, described the numbers as “generally reliable.”

“They have access to data that are difficult for other sources to have,” Mr Shakir told The Independent. “In particular, they aggregate data coming from different hospitals and morgues and compile them together. That’s why we, the UN, the US State Department have regularly cited their numbers.” Human Rights Watch had conducted their own independent investigations into particular strikes, says Mr Shakir, and they found the ministry’s numbers to be generally consistent, “with no major deviations from the figures that they have provided.”

The devastating list of Palestinian deaths released by the health ministry on Thursday stretched to more than 200 pages. The ministry produced a separate list specifically to document the children killed since Israel’s attack on Gaza began, of which there were 2665, with 248 of that number unidentified.

The White House repeatedly declined to directly state whether Mr Biden’s remarks on the reliability — or lack thereof — of casualty counts coming out of Gaza indicated a change in policy by the US, despite the State Department’s use of Gaza health ministry data during past conflicts.

A White House official instead referred The Independent to remarks delivered during a Thursday press briefing by John Kirby, a National Security Council (NSC) spokesman, in which he described the ministry as a “front for Hamas.”

“It’s run by Hamas, a terrorist organization,” said Mr Kirby. “I’ve said it myself up here: We can’t take anything coming out of Hamas, including the so-called Ministry of Health, at face value.”

Mr Kirby conceded that there “have been civilian casualties” as the result of Israel’s bombardment, and there “likely will be more [...] because that’s what war is. It’s brutal. It’s ugly. It’s messy.”

The health ministry in Gaza is part of a government run by Hamas, which seized control of the strip in 2007, but it employs civil servants and an administration that predates the takeover.

An NSC spokesperson also pointed to the health ministry’s claim that 500 people were killed by a strike at the Al Ahli hospital, but that the US intelligence community assessed the number of deaths to be between 100 and 300.

Mr Shakir, of Human Rights Watch, said there was a clear distinction between initial statements from the ministry immediately following a strike and the final list of names. The ministry later revised the total of those killed in the hospital strike to 471.

The US has its own history of undercounting civilian deaths. During the US-led coalition’s campaign to destroy Isis in Iraq and Syria, the Pentagon officially estimated that it killed 1,437 civilians. Airwars , an organisation that tracks reports of civilian casualties, estimates the real number to be between 8,199 and 13,259 based on its own investigations.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of inflating the numbers killed, but has so far declined to offer an alternative death toll, despite reporting casualty numbers in previous conflicts. When asked on Thursday Lt. Col Richard Hecht, a spokesperson for the military, said again they did not have casualty figures. He told journalists to take numbers released by the Gaza health ministry ""with a pinch of salt”.

The Israeli military has said it believes civilians in Gaza have been killed by hundreds of Palestinian rockets which misfired and did not make it across the border to Israel.

Mr Biden’s comments, and the follow-up clarifications from the White House, have reverberated among Arab and Muslim communities in the US, many of whom have been consumed by a constant stream of graphic images and news from Gaza for three weeks.

Hala Alyan, a Palestinian-American writer and clinical psychologist based in New York City, described Mr Biden’s comments as “startling” and likely to have a lasting impact.

“There is already a real dehumanisation happening around the language that is being used about Palestinians, both in terms of how their deaths are described, what they are equated with, in terms of the language used to describe them,”she told The Independent.

“It plants the seed that delegitimises even the people who have been killed. Even the dead can’t be named as dead,” she added.

Mr Biden was questioned specifically about his remarks during a meeting with Muslim and Arab leaders at the White House on Thursday, according to Politico , who reportedly argued that messaging from his administration was feeding into Islamaphobia.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, condemned Mr Biden’s “shocking and dehumanising” comments, which followed one of the deadliest days of bombing since the conflict began, during which 704 Palestinians, including 305 children, were killed.

“Countless videos coming out of Gaza every day show mangled bodies of Palestinian women and children – and entire city blocks leveled to the ground,” CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. “President Biden should watch some of these videos and ask himself if the crushed children being dragged out of the ruins of their family homes are a fabrication or an acceptable price of war. They are neither.”",Resume259,[],2023-10-27 21:02:54+00:00,"['rights', 'mr', 'ministry', 'comments', 'released', 'death', 'questioned', 'toll', 'biden', 'health', 'gazas', 'numbers', 'names', 'state', 'palestinians', 'gaza', 'killed', 'bidens']",the_independent_articles

Britain risks being “left in the cold” if it continues to ignore the growing calls for slavery reparations, an MP has warned, ahead of a conference to demand action.

Campaigners from around the world are gathering in London this weekend for a two-day meeting to discuss the government’s responsibility to consider compensation.

Momentum has gathered in the past year with calls for action coming from the Caribbean, Africa, the EU and the UN, building upon years of lobbying around the cause from campaigners.

Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Afrikan reparations, said the UK had a “moral duty” to face up to the past.

“The UN, other governments, religious institutions and NGOs have all accepted they need to address their role in the enslavement of African people and the legacy of racism and impoverishment it left behind,” she told The Independent.

“The UK has a moral duty to address reparative justice.

“For decades grassroots organisations have fought for the level of recognition that the global reparations movement has today.

“If our government doesn’t value the moral arguments they should take heed of the changing global power structures, and understand that we may be left in the cold if we do not address these historical injustices now.”

Leading figures in the reparations movement, including Dr Julius Garvey, son of renowned activist Marcus Garvey, and Diane Abbott, Britain’s first Black woman MP, are involved in the Westminster conference.

Campaigners are looking to lobby the royal family, Lloyd’s of London and the Church of England as well as the government for financial recompense for their role in the slave trade.

In September, 15 Caribbean nations joined forces to draft a letter demanding that European countries pay slavery reparations to the tune of £33 trillion, with Britain singled out for £19.6 trillion in compensation.

Earlier this year, the UN called on Britain to take action over reparations, as part of a damning report into racism in the UK. The EU also hinted at the need for reparations, describing slavery as a “crime against humanity”.

And in the summer, the Dutch king, Willem-Alexander, apologised for the Netherlands‘ historical involvement in slavery and its ongoing effects, though the country’s prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the government would not pay reparations, going against recommendations made by an advisory panel in 2021.

Though not quite the same as financial reparations and more donations than anything else, white, aristocratic families who benefited from slavery decided to make small monetary payments to the countries they owned slaves in, from former British prime minister Sir William Gladstone’s descendants in Guyana, to the Trevelyan family with Grenada.

Last month, an arm of the National Health Service in Scotland announced it would make non-financial reparations for its historical links to slavery following new research highlighting its connections with the slave trade.

At the beginning of this year, the Church of England committed £100m to a fund it is setting up to compensate for its historical benefit from the international slave trade.

But the UK government is continuing to resist reparations.

Prime minister Rishi Sunak refused to apologise for the UK’s role in historical slavery and colonialism, rejecting a call to commit to reparations when challenged in the Commons in April.

In a recent exclusive interview with The Independent, the prime minister of Grenada issued fresh calls for Britain to pay slavery reparations to its former colonies.

Following the Gladstone family’s apology, Guyana’s president, Irfaan Ali, renewed calls for Britain to pay slavery reparations, as did Ghanaian president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo

Ahead of King Charles III’s coronation in May, more than a dozen Commonwealth representatives called upon the monarch to apologise and pay reparations for slavery .

Since Barbados became a republic in November 2021, replacing the late Queen with a president as its head of state, other nations including Jamaica have signalled an intention to do the same, breathing new life into the reparations movement.

Hamas released two American hostages from captivity on Friday, two weeks after they were kidnapped and transported to Gaza by the Palestinian militant group during its deadly rampage through southern Israel.

Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter Natalie, 17, were released to the Red Cross and are now in the hands of the Israeli military. An image of the pair was later released by the Israeli government showing them accompanied by Israeli soldiers after crossing the border.

Natalie’s father Uri Raanan said that he spoke to his daughter on Friday. “She’s doing good. She’s doing very good,” he said. “I’m in tears, and I feel very, very good.”

Mr Raanan, 71, from Chicago, said he saw on the news earlier on Friday that an American mother and daughter would be released by Hamas, and he spent the day hoping that meant his daughter and her mother, Judith. Knowing Natalie may be able to celebrate her 18th birthday next week at home with family and friends feels “wonderful, the best news”, Mr Raanan said.

The mother and daughter were visiting Israel from Illinois when they were taken captive. They had been staying in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, near Gaza. Roughly 200 people were taken hostage and 1,400 killed during the 7 October attack, which prompted a devastating Israeli military assault on Gaza in response.

President Joe Biden confirmed the release in a statement on Friday in which he said the US government had been working “around-the-clock” to free American citizens held by Hamas.

“Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,” Mr Biden said, giving thanks to the governments of Qatar and Israel for their help in securing the release.

“As president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world,” he added.

Qatar’s foreign ministry said the release came after “many days of continuous communication” with all parties.

A statement released by Hamas on its Telegram channel said a mother and her daughter were released “in response to Qatari efforts”. It continued that the release was for “humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by [Joe] Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless.”

Responding to the hostage release, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: “Hamas presents itself to the world as having returned the women they took hostage on humanitarian grounds, while Hamas is in fact a murderous terrorist organisation that right now is holding infants, children, women and elderly people hostage in the Gaza Strip, and continuing to commit crimes against humanity.”

Israel responded to the 7 October massacre by bombarding the densely populated Gaza Strip with airstrikes and artillery fire, killing more than 4,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It has vowed to wipe out Hamas in Gaza and has made preparations for a ground offensive into the territory.

Gaza is in the grips of a serious humanitarian crisis as a result of a “total siege” imposed on the 42km-long (26 miles) territory by the Israeli government, which cut off power, water, fuel and food to the 2.3 million people who live there.

Doctors Without Borders warned on Friday that Gaza’s healthcare system is “facing collapse”.",Resume261,[],2023-10-20 23:55:04+00:00,"['hostage', 'released', 'hamas', 'raanan', 'verifyerrors', 'daughter', 'mother', 'israeli', 'teenage', 'gaza', 'hostages', 'release', 'american']",the_independent_articles

Israeli forces have been bombing Gaza for more than a week in response to the brutal massacre of more than 1,300 of its citizens by Hamas. In that time, more than 2,300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes, including more than 700 children.

Israel has imposed a “total siege” of Gaza, cutting off the flow of food, medicine, water and electricity, and told the estimated one million residents of the north to flee south ahead of a planned ground invasion.

Aid agencies and relief organisations have warned of a humanitarian crisis in the densely populated territory, which is home to more than 2.3 million people.

UN spokeswoman Inas Hamdan said Sunday that a quarter-of-a-million people in Gaza had moved to shelters over the past 24 hours, the majority of which were UN schools where “clean water has actually run out.”

Below are excerpts from statements about the unfolding situation in Gaza released in the past few days.

‘A death sentence for the sick and injured’ — World Health Organisation

“The forced evacuation of patients and health workers will further worsen the current humanitarian and public health catastrophe.

The lives of many critically ill and fragile patients hang in the balance: those in intensive care or who rely on life support; patients undergoing hemodialysis; newborns in incubators; women with complications of pregnancy, and others all face imminent deterioration of their condition or death if they are forced to move and are cut off from life-saving medical attention while being evacuated.

Health facilities in northern Gaza continue to receive an influx of injured patients and are struggling to operate beyond maximum capacity. Some patients are being treated in corridors and outdoors in surrounding streets due to a lack of hospital beds.

Forcing more than 2000 patients to relocate to southern Gaza, where health facilities are already running at maximum capacity and unable to absorb a dramatic rise in the number patients, could be tantamount to a death sentence.”

‘Humanity is failing’ — Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for the United Nation’s Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator

“In Gaza, families have been bombed while inching their way south along congested, damaged roads, following an evacuation order that left hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for safety but with nowhere to go.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed and many more have been injured.

There is no power, no water and no fuel. Food supplies are running dangerously low.

Hospitals, overwhelmed with patients, are running out of medicine.

Morgues are overflowing.

Homes, schools, shelters, health centers and places of worship are under intense bombardment.

Entire residential neighbourhoods have been razed to the ground.

Aid workers have been killed.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza, already critical, is fast becoming untenable.

In the West Bank, violence is on the rise, with a surge in civilian deaths and injuries. Families are facing ever greater movement restrictions.

And in Lebanon, the risk of the conflict spilling into the country is a major concern.

The parties’ actions and rhetoric over the past few days are extremely alarming and unacceptable.

Even wars have rules, and these rules must be upheld, at all times, and by all sides.

Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers and assets, must be protected.

Civilians must be allowed to leave for safer areas. And whether they move or stay, constant care must be taken to spare them.

Essential supplies and services and unimpeded humanitarian access must be allowed.

Anyone held captive must be treated humanely. All hostages must be released.

All countries with influence must exert it to ensure respect for the rules of war and to avoid any further escalation and spillover.

The past week has been a test for humanity, and humanity is failing.”

‘Shelters are no longer safe’ — The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees

“Despite the order to evacuate more than 1 million persons from northern Gaza and Gaza City to the southern Gaza Strip, many, particularly pregnant women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, will not be able to flee the area. They have no choice and must be protected at all times.

Wars have rules. Civilians, hospitals, schools, clinics and United Nations premises cannot be a target. UNRWA is sparing no efforts to advocate with parties to the conflicts to meet their obligations under international law to protect civilians, including those seeking refuge in UNRWA shelters.

UNRWA shelters in Gaza and northern Gaza are no longer safe. This is unprecedented.

This war should be no exception, protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including United Nations buildings, applies to this conflict too.”

‘We are calling for the most elementary humanity’ — Doctors Without Borders

“As the ultimatum given to the population expires, MSF calls on the Israeli authorities to show humanity.

Despite Israeli announcements suggesting that there are safe areas for the population trapped in the Gaza Strip, they are in fact exposed to bombardment throughout all the territory, including in the south, where tens of thousands of people have fled following the ultimatum.

As the Israeli army has been bombarding the Gaza Strip without restraint for a week, we are calling for the most elementary humanity to be shown.

The injunction to nearly 1.1 million people to move in a few hours to an already overpopulated territory with precarious access to food, water and healthcare is as absurd as it is intolerable. Our teams are witnessing the fact that drinking water is becoming scarce in the south of the Gaza Strip and the difficulty of obtaining it is adding to the distress of the population. MSF urgently calls for the restoration of sufficient and immediate access to drinking water for the population of the Gaza Strip.”

‘People have nowhere safe to go’ — International Committee of the Red Cross

“The instructions issued by the Israeli authorities for the population of Gaza City to immediately leave their homes, coupled with the complete siege explicitly denying them food, water, and electricity, are not compatible with international humanitarian law.

When military powers order people to leave their homes, all possible measures must be taken to ensure the population has access to basic necessities like food and water and that members of the same family are not separated.

Gaza is a closed area of limited size and resources. People have nowhere safe to go and many, including the disabled, elderly, and sick, will not be able to leave their homes. International humanitarian law protects all civilians, including those who remain. Today, it is impossible for Gazans to know which areas will next face attack.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is scaling up to provide life-saving relief. But our teams will require pauses in the fighting to work safely and effectively. With a military siege in place, humanitarian organisations including the ICRC will not be able to assist such a massive displacement of people in Gaza. The needs are staggering, and humanitarian organizations must be able to increase aid operations.”

The skies over New Mexico are be filled with balloons as the area kickstarts celebrations for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.

Held until 15 October, the fiesta opens today (7 October) with a mass ascension of balloons. Other events across the week will include a gas balloon race, balloon glows, competitions, and plenty of photo opportunities.

Barbara Fricke and Peter Cuneo are preparing for a three-day stint in their balloon as they compete to travel the farthest distance in one of the world’s most prestigious races.

“You’ve got to start thinking — yes, I’m going to live in this basket for three days, and this is going to be home, and I’m just camping out in the sky,” Fricke said.

Watch as the winner of the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize is announced on Friday 6 October.

Imprisoned activist Narges Mohammadi won the award for fighting oppression of women in Iran and and her efforts to promote human rights and freedom for all.

Last year’s prize was shared between human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties and Memorial, a rights group banned in Russia.

Several other Nobel Prize winners have already been announced this week.

The physics prize was given to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier for research that demonstrated a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to capture and study rapid processes inside atoms.

Jon Fosse, a Norwegian author, playwright and poet, claimed the prize for literature. His work focused on “anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death”.

The prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, who developed the technology that led to the mRNA Covid vaccines.

All Onewheel e-skateboards have been recalled worldwide after four people died while riding them and many others have been significantly injured. Future Motion, the company who owns Onewheel is now facing 31 lawsuits in the US.

Future Motion told the BBC that the recall applied to devices sold worldwide and not just in the US as American watchdog the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled all 300,000 devices sold in the country citing a risk of crashes causing serious injuries.

Four deaths were reported between 2019 and 2021 involving Onewheel and the CPSC’s recall notice added there had also been significant injuries such as “traumatic brain injury, concussion, paralysis, upper-body fractures, lower-body fractures and ligament damage”.

At least three of the four deaths were incidents where the rider was not wearing a helmet according to the CPSC, and all deaths were a result of head trauma. Both Future Motion and the CPSC encourage people using their products to wear protective equipment such as helmets and knee pads.

The firm is also facing 31 lawsuits in the US according to a legal document filed by them last month by litigants who allege that “they fell because the Onewheel stopped or shut off unxpectedly”.

One UK store, The Snowboard Shop, stopped sales of Onewheel electric skateboards from their store and have updated their website with a redirection that allows prospective buyers to enquire about the product but gives them no option to buy it. The store is then responding to enquiries with information about the recall.

All models of Onewheel electric skateboards are affected and this includes the original Onewheel, as well as the Onewheel+, Onewheel+XR, Onewheel Pint, Onewheel Pint x and Onewheel GT models.

There are 31 lawsuits taking place against the company in the US where people “allege that they fell because the Onewheel stopped or shut off unexpectedly”. (Getty Images)

Recall requests must be made through a link on Future Motion’s website.

In a statement on their site Future Motion said: “We are announcing a voluntary recall of all Onewheel electric skateboards, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The skateboards can stop balancing the rider if the boards’ limits are exceeded, posing a crash hazard that can result in serious injury or death.

“To address this, we have developed an innovative new safety alert feature called “haptic buzz” that will be available to Onewheel GT, Pint X, Pint, and XR riders through an important firmware update. Haptic buzz is an alert riders can hear and feel when experiencing certain situations that can result in a crash.”",Resume267,[],2023-10-04 06:48:41+00:00,"['stopped', 'recalled', 'pint', 'future', 'cpsc', 'verifyerrors', 'store', 'skateboards', 'injuries', 'deaths', 'email', 'motion', 'worldwide', 'onewheel', 'significant']",the_independent_articles

A scientific breakthrough has confirmed how early man left Africa some 84,000 years ago.

A “well-watered corridor” of river channels across the Sinai peninsula and through Jordan was the route early humans took toward Europe and Asia, scientists from the University of Southampton claim to have proved.

Examining hand tools found on the edge of ancient river channels that have dried up over time, the team used specialist dating techniques to discover they were likely to have been used around 84,000 years ago.

The scientists, working with colleagues around the world, say it proves the Homo sapiens navigated their way along the river channels through the Jordan Rift Valley on their way from Africa for Euraisa.

Paul Carling, Professor of Geomorphology at the University of Southampton, said: “It’s long been thought that when the sea level was low, humans used a southern crossing, via the Red Sea from the horn of Africa, to get to south-western Arabia.

“However, our study confirms there was a well-trodden passage to the north, across the only land-route from Africa to Eurasia.

“Our newly published evidence is a key piece of the puzzle that shows humans migrated using a northern route – using small wetland areas as bases whilst hunting abundant wildlife in the drier grasslands.

“Although previous studies have looked for large lakes as potential watering holes, in fact small wetlands were very important as staging posts during the migration.”

Scientists from the Undersity of Southampton say early man took water channels across the Sinai Peninsula and into Jordan (Getty)

The study, published in the journal Science Advances, was the result of scientists using luminescence dating techniques to help establish the age of the sediment the tools were buried in by estimating how long it had been since the sediment was last exposed to light.

The results showed the tools were likely to have been used in the time period humans left Africa for Eurasia. Modern humans evolved in Africa between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago and dispersed out of the continent in several stages to then populate Asia and then Europe.

Dr Mahmoud Abbas, the study’s lead author from Shantou University, China, said: “The Levant acted as a well-watered corridor for modern humans to disperse out of Africa during the last interglacial, and we have now demonstrated this is the case in the Jordan Rift Valley zone.

“The paleohydrological evidence from the Jordan desert enhances our understanding of the environmental setting at that time.

“Rather than dry desert, savannah grasslands would have provided the much-needed resources for humans to survive during their journey out of Africa and into south-west Asia and beyond.”",Resume268,[],2023-10-03 19:33:00+00:00,"['early', 'used', 'confirms', 'scientists', 'man', 'left', 'scientific', 'verifyerrors', 'valley', 'ago', '84000', 'humans', 'university', 'email', 'jordan', 'channels', 'africa', 'breakthrough']",the_independent_articles

A suicide bomber let off an explosive device outside the Turkish parliament just hours before it was set to reopen after summer recess, officials said.

A second man was killed after a shootout with police started when both suspects arrived in a vehicle near the entrance to Turkey’s interior affairs ministry in Ankara.

Turkey’s interior minister also tweeted that two police officers were injured during the attack.

It happened just before president Recep Tayyip Erdogan was set to deliver an address to parliament.

Television footage showed bomb squads working near a parked vehicle in the area which is located near Turkey’s National Assembly.

There was no immediate information on the attackers. However, Kurdish and far-left militant groups as well as the Islamic State group have carried out deadly attacks in the past.

Last year, six people were killed and 81 were wounded in an explosion in Istanbul. Turkey blamed Kurdish militants for the attack.

In 2015 and 2016, Kurdish militants, Islamic State and other groups either claimed or were blamed for several attacks in major Turkish cities.

Justice minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation had now been launched into the “terror attack”. “These attacks will in no way hinder Turkey’s fight against terrorism. Our fight against terrorism will continue with more determination,” he said.

Police cordoned off access to the city centre and increased security measures, warning citizens that they would be conducting controlled explosions of suspicious packages.

At 7.30pm, President Tayyip Erdogan was set to attend the opening of parliament, which in the coming weeks is expected to consider ratifying Sweden’s bid to join Nato after Turkey had raised initial objections.

The bride and groom of a wedding celebration in Iraq where a devastating fire killed around 100 people have joined crowds of mourners remembering the victims.

The newlywed pair, named locally as Haneen and Revan, were initially thought to have died in the inferno at the banqueting hall in the Christian town of Qaraqosh, in Nineveh province, on Tuesday night - but survived after reportedly escaping through a kitchen door.

On Thursday, video emerged on social media purportedly showing them with grieving families remembering the victims, despite them having been treated in hospital following the fire. The footage appeared to show the groom sobbing with a man holding him up from behind.

Bizhar Zubair, news editor at Kurdish news outlet Rudaw, wrote on X: “Groom’s first appearance after his heartfelt attempt to start a new family took a tragic turn at his wedding as a devastating fire in the wedding party hall left numerous families shattered.”

Middle East author Ninve Ermagan also wrote on the platform: “You can see the pain of the bride and groom - it is a tragedy for the already disadvantaged Assyrian Christian minority.”

On Thursday two more burn victims - a 30-year-old woman and a four-year-old child - died from their injuries.

Dozens more people, including children, are being treated for severe burns. Survivors say the fire started when fireworks hit the roof during the ceremonial slow dance.

It is a tragedy which has plunged the northern town into mourning with grieving families continuing funeral processions at the Saint Behnam Syriac Catholic Church on Thursday. The huge gathering followed a ceremony at The Cemetery of the Resurrection on Wednesday.

At a packed memorial service inside Al-Tahira Church on Wednesday, a priest told mourners: “Nothing is up to standard in this country.....we have to hold those who are responsible accountable. Enough, enough.”

The Civil Defence Directorate, speaking to Iraqi News Agency, said the banqueting hall was covered with highly flammable metal composite panels, which was in violation of safety regulations.

The directorate said: “The fire led to the collapse of parts of the hall as a result of the use of highly flammable, low-cost building materials that collapse within minutes when the fire breaks out.”

Officials have so far arrested 10 of the venue’s staff, its owner and three people involved with the fireworks, as they promise a quick investigation into what happened.

A government spokesperson said the authorities will also conduct strict inspections of hotels, schools, restaurants and event venues to make sure they are complying with safety standards.

One owner of the venue, Chonny Suleiman Naboo, told The Associated Press that an electrical fault caused the fire and denied that they had neglected safety procedures.

The events unfolded as, on Thursday, Iraq’s prime minsiter Mohammed Shia al-Sudani arrived in the region to meet with the wounded and family members of victims at Hamdaniyah Hospital and Al-Jumhoori Hospital.

A teenager has stabbed three teachers and at least one pupil in a high school in southern Spain, police have said.

One of the teachers was stabbed in the eye during the attack in Jerez de la Frontera, southern Spain, on Thursday morning, according to local reports.

The other three victims suffered minor wounds, a source from Andalusia’s health services said.

Police and emergency services were called to the stabbing at the Elena García Armada Institute at around 8.25am.

A teenager allegedly took a knife from his rucksack shortly after arriving before attacking classmates, according to news outlet ABC Sevilla.

When a teacher intervened, she was stabbed in the eye, according to the reports, which add that another teacher who came to her aid was also injured.

A 14-year-old has been arrested over the stabbing and taken into police custody.

Police spokesman Adrian Dominguez told reporters: “Police located the suspect on the third floor. He had in his possession the two knives used to attack three teachers and two students.”

Speaking to Spanish news agency EFE, a pupil said: “He started to attack everyone, even the teacher. He almost caught my friend and hit another friend in the forearm. And my physics and chemistry teacher in the head.”

A pupil’s mother told Canal SUR television channel that the attacker had wielded two large knives from his backpack and attacked fellow pupils and teachers, telling them he would kill them.

The first teacher attacked is in a serious condition and was taken to Jerez de la Frontera University Hospital where they are expected to undergo surgery. The rest of those injured have also gone to the same hospital for treatment.

The secondary school was immediately evacuated following the incident. Pictures from outside the school show parents and students waiting for news from inside the campus.

Jerez de la Frontera mayor María José García Pelayo said: “It was devastating and dramatic because all the parents were on the outside of the school wishing they could hug their children.”",Resume272,[],2023-09-28 15:22:33+00:00,"['frontera', 'stabbed', 'rampage', 'sign', 'verifyerrors', 'teacher', 'spanish', 'teenager', 'la', 'student', 'breaking', 'school', 'email', 'teachers', 'knife']",the_independent_articles

A tradesman faked his own kidnapping to spend New Year’s Eve with his mistress - only to be caught when his alarmed partner alerted police.

Paul Iera, 35, from Woolongong in New South Wales in Australia, narrowly avoided jail after admitting to come up with the fanciful scenario in a desperate attempt to cover his cheating.

Woolongong Local Court heard how he left his partner on December 31 to meet his mistress, initially telling her he was meeting a “financial guy”. But when he sought to stay away a while longer, he came up with the kidnapping hoax.

His partner then received a text with a fake ransom message which read: “Thank you for sending Paul to me, now payback is a ***** bye bye. We will keep him with us until the morning wen (sic) he gives us his bike we call it square.”

Having read it, Iera’s partner panicked and called the local Lake Illawarra Police District, which set up a task force - named Strike Force Evision - and put in 200 hours police work to investigate the alleged kidnapping.

Less than 24 hours later, Iera was discovered by officers in his white van along with his lover. But bizarrely, Iera continued his story and told officers he had been taken by a group of unknown Middle Eastern men and was later let go.

However, 12 days later, his story fell apart and he was arrested and charged with making a false accusation with the intent to subject another person to investigation.

In court, magistrate Michael Ong slammed his “abhorrent behaviour”. He added: “You chose to send alarming, frightening messages to your partner so you could get some extra time with another partner.

“You thought that would be a great way to do it. Any reasonable person would have gone to the police and that is exactly what happened.”

Iera was served a three-year community correction order, and ordered to pay around £8,500 in compensation for the work by police.",Resume273,[],2023-09-28 13:36:48+00:00,"['mistress', 'sign', 'iera', 'man', 'verifyerrors', 'work', 'partner', 'australian', 'meet', 'kidnapping', 'faked', 'breaking', 'email', 'read', 'later', 'valid']",the_independent_articles

Fewer than 12 per cent women dignitaries addressed a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York as top world leaders flagged the skewed gender representation at the biggest international gathering.

UN deputy secretary-general Amina Mohammed said member nations need to be called out for their poor representation of women at the UNGA meet last week.

A total 130 world leaders and more than 50 ministers addressed the annual meeting but only 21 of these dignitaries – six heads of state, four heads of government, one vice president, nine ministers and one vice minister – were women.

“We have to be courageous enough… to call people out, delegation by delegation, when you meet them,” Ms Mohammed said.

“It is clear and abundant in the hall, when you’re sitting at the podium and you’re looking down, it’s true – I’m searching for the women and that has to get better,” she said.

The women who addressed the UNGA included Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong, UAE’s minister of state for international cooperation Reem Ebrahim al-Hashimy and Jamaica’s foreign affairs minister Kamina Johnson Smith.

Of the 189 member countries who spoke, there were 88 heads of state and 42 heads of government, said senior UN official Movses Abelian.

The remaining speakers were made up of deputy leaders and ministers, along with six ambassadors.

Only four nations did not address the six-day meeting, diplomats said. These were Niger, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Madagascar.

This is not the first time a poor gender ratio has been flagged at an assembly session.

South African president Cyril Ramaphosa drew applause on the first day of the UNGA meet when he said women comprised half of his cabinet. He also said he was accompanied to New York by an all-female delegation.

Fewer than 12 per cent women dignitaries addressed a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York as top world leaders flagged the skewed gender representation at the biggest international gathering.

UN deputy secretary-general Amina Mohammed said member nations need to be called out for their poor representation of women at the UNGA meet last week.

A total 130 world leaders and more than 50 ministers addressed the annual meeting but only 21 of these dignitaries – six heads of state, four heads of government, one vice president, nine ministers and one vice minister – were women.

“We have to be courageous enough… to call people out, delegation by delegation, when you meet them,” Ms Mohammed said.

“It is clear and abundant in the hall, when you’re sitting at the podium and you’re looking down, it’s true – I’m searching for the women and that has to get better,” she said.

The women who addressed the UNGA included Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong, UAE’s minister of state for international cooperation Reem Ebrahim al-Hashimy and Jamaica’s foreign affairs minister Kamina Johnson Smith.

Of the 189 member countries who spoke, there were 88 heads of state and 42 heads of government, said senior UN official Movses Abelian.

The remaining speakers were made up of deputy leaders and ministers, along with six ambassadors.

Only four nations did not address the six-day meeting, diplomats said. These were Niger, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Madagascar.

This is not the first time a poor gender ratio has been flagged at an assembly session.

South African president Cyril Ramaphosa drew applause on the first day of the UNGA meet when he said women comprised half of his cabinet. He also said he was accompanied to New York by an all-female delegation.

“It should be a matter of concern to us all that the majority of people who are sitting in this assembly are men,” he said. “The question we have to ask: where are the women of the world? The women of the world have a right to be here.”

Putin’s Black Sea fleet commander ‘killed in navy attack’ as Ukraine breakthrough triggers ‘panic’,"For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Vladimir Putin’s commander of his Black Sea Fleet has been killed in a missile strike in annexed Crimea, claims Ukraine - as ‘panic’ grips Russian military over battlefield advances on the southern frontline.

Admiral Viktor Sokolov was among 34 officers who died when British-made Storm Shadow missiles hit the Russian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol during the devastating attack by Kyiv on Friday.

The loss of Sokolov - said to have been handpicked by Putin for the job last year - was announced by the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces in a social media update on Monday.

Moscow has not yet responded to the claim, which came as the Ukraine counteroffensive in the southern frontline in Zaporizhzhia triggered “panic” for a Russian source quoted by a US-based war monitoring think-tank.

However, on Sunday night, Russia replied with a heavy round of airstrikes on the Black Sea port of Odesa in a likely attempt to stop its export of grain and other commodities including steel. Two people were killed in the bombing, according to local officials.

The series of events started on Friday when Ukraine launched the attack on Russia’s Navy headquarters to coincide with a naval commanders’ meeting at the base. Pictures and video from the scene showed smoke coming from a large building at the hub.

The Russian defence ministry initially said that the strike had killed one service member, but later issued a statement that he was missing. Then, on Monday, Ukrainian Special Operations Forces said Sokolov was among the 34 killed during the missile strike. They also claimed that 105 other occupiers were injured.

Russia appointed Sokolov its new commander for its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet in August 2022, according to a state media outlet at the time. He had been serving as the Naval Academy chief since 2020.

The apparent death of the commander comes as fierce fighting continues on the southern front line - known as the Surovikin line - which Ukrainian forces reportedly broke through for the first time with armoured vehicles last week.

According to a report published by the Institute for the Study of War, the tanks managed to break the 81-mile line heavily fortified with defensive weapons, including tank traps, minefields and huge concrete blocks designed to stop armoured vehicles.

And on Monday, the Ukrainian General Staff reported that its forces captured new unspecified locations near Verbove with a source affiliated to Putin’s elite military unit VDV reportedly saying Ukrainian forces occupied half of the settlement.

“For how long can [ Minister of Defence of Russia Sergei] Shoigu’s MoD hide the breakthrough in Verbove?” the source said, accusing the Russian ministry of defence of trying to conceal Ukraine’s tactical progress in Verbove, according to think-tank the Institute for the Study of War

Verbove is a few miles east of Robotyne, that was retaken by Ukraine earlier this month. Its capture would be key in the advancement by Ukrainian troops toward the Sea of Azov, which if reached could effectively cut Russian forces in half.

However, Russia hit back on Sunday night with a large-scale attack on the port of Odesa with two people working in a warehouse in the city killed, according to the regional head Oleh Kiper. Fire also ripped through the empty Hotel Odesa after the drone and missile attack from Moscow.

The events came as there was a bizarre situation in the Canadian House of Commons, where there was a standing ovation to a Ukrainian veteran who had served in a Nazi SS unit during the Second World War.

The US explorer Mark Dickey has relived his dramatic rescue from deep inside a Turkish cave this summer, recalling how he was “ready to die”.

Dickey embarked on an expedition to Turkey’s Morca cave on 29 August. At 1,276 metres, it is the third deepest cave in the country.

On day four of the expedition, he suddenly started vomiting and defecating blood. By the fifth day, he was on the brink of death.

“What I can remember is an immediate and sudden increase in exhaustion,” Dickey told The Telegraph. “I had been feeling slightly more lethargic earlier in the day but then suddenly I got really, really tired.

“My consciousness actually felt like it was diminished like it suddenly got harder to think. I needed to vomit. I needed to go to the bathroom. I had hot and cold flushes rapidly, and broke out into a sweat. I felt like I was going to pass out.”

Some 24 hours later, Dickey felt that he wouldn’t survive: “The pulse on my wrist was becoming extremely, extremely difficult to feel, and it reached the point where it was impossible to count. The thought transitioned to ‘I am probably going to die here’.”

Dickey, 41, is a US researcher, search and rescue specialist and caving enthusiast who has ventured to depths of 1,000 metres at least 20 times over the previous two decades.

He previously visited Morca in 2022, and was returning to explore uncharted caverns and passages to judge whether it would be suitable for training novice Turkish cavers.

Mr Dickey’s fiancée and fellow caver Jessica Van Ord was with him when he fell ill and stayed with him until medics arrived and gave him IV fluid and blood.

She eventually climbed out and stayed at a base camp near the mouth of the cave, while working with the 150-strong team of cavers who travelled to Turkey to help bring Mr Dickey out by stretcher.

The volunteers initially worked to stabilise Mr Dickey’s condition before he could be moved. He required a doctor to administer vials of blood to keep him stabilised.

Eventually, his bleeding had stopped and he was able to walk unassisted, according to Cave Rescue Bulgaria.

Then the mission to extricate him began, with rescue teams setting up medical “base camps” at various depths throughout the caves where they could rest and recuperate.

Rescue teams used explosives to blast open parts of the cave to safely extract him. Rock hammers were also used by rescuers to make way for a stretcher to ensure Mr Dickey’s safety during ascent.

It took three days for a number of rescue teams working in relay to extract him, navigating steep cliffs and narrow passages.

At the surface, Dickey was airlifted to a hospital in Ankara, the Turkish capital, where tests identified his illness as gastrointestinal bleeding triggered by a lesion in his intestine, the cause of which remains unknown.

Upon his rescue, Dickey said that it was “amazing to be above ground again”, as he was taken to a medical tent for examination before he could be transferred to hospital after his ordeal.

He thanked the rescue teams and Turkish government for bringing him to safety and said they had “saved my life, literally no questions asked”.

A New Jersey native and current resident of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, Dickey is a highly-trained caver, and cave rescuer himself and is well-known in the international speleological (cave expert) community, according to the European Cave Rescue Association (ECRA).

His resume of cave explorations and expert status is endless: secretary of the ECRA medical committee, lead instructor for Caving Academy, a US-based organisation that prepares other cavers for exploration, and a national instructor for the National Cave Rescue Commission.

Since his discharge from the hospital, Dickey has said that he is keen to go caving as soon as next month, despite the risk his illness might strike again.

“Caving is one of the final frontiers of exploration,” he said. “We are pushing the exploration of the world in one of the few places where humans have never been.

“Is there anything to do differently? No. I can make sure I have no pre-existing medical condition and as long as I have no increased risks of recurrence then I’ll go caving.”",Resume277,[],2023-09-23 12:32:30+00:00,"['caving', '1200m', 'deep', 'mark', 'cave', 'teams', 'rescue', 'verifyerrors', 'turkey', 'medical', 'dickeys', 'survived', 'rescued', 'dickey', 'turkish', 'morca']",the_independent_articles

It was already a diplomatically thorny visit for Justin Trudeau to India for last weekend’s G20, with relations between the two countries souring in recent months. But things only got more awkward as Trudeau was forced to stay an extra two days in Delhi after his prime ministerial plane was hit by a mechanical issue.

The Canadian leader’s visit for the G20 summit was prolonged by the unexpected delay in fixing the issue with his Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) plane, as well as the failure of a replacement plane on Monday that could have brought him back earlier – leaving him and his Canadian delegation stranded abroad for days.

The embarrassing incident is surprisingly far from the only recent example of a world leader or senior minister being stranded on foreign soil by a breakdown involving their official aircraft.

In August, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and her delegation to Abu Dhabi were forced to go back to a layover airport after the Airbus she used suffered a problem with a landing flap failing to open.

Experts say that while the cause of such incidents may vary, they can typically be traced to a lack of defence spending by the country involved.

Technical issues are primarily due to two reasons – using old or obsolete aircraft (a practice that is particularly common with nations under international sanctions), or a country’s economic situation or political reluctance to spend large amounts maintaining superior fleets of aircraft for their heads of state and government.

Trudeau’s 36-year-old Airbus A310 remained stationed on the tarmac in New Delhi for two days until a replacement Airbus CC-150 Polaris managed to fly him out of his plane misery.

Canada has a relatively low defence budget that impacts it in a number of ways, including limiting what it can offer Ukraine in terms of military aid. It’s a lack of spending that leaves even the prime minister out in the cold.

It ranks 25th out of 31 Nato members on defence spending, committing only 1.2 per cent of its GDP in 2022, according to the alliance’s latest data this year. Germany ranks just two spots above Canada in terms of spending.

“The Germans and Canadians are using aircraft which, for commercial reasons, have already fallen out of favour globally and have been withdrawn by various users,” says Angad Singh, an independent defence analyst.

“The bulk of users of [the Airbus] 310 were very quick to ditch the aircraft the moment it was replaced by [Airbus] 330 or [Boeing] 777,” he tells The Independent.

Using an outdated model limits the availability of maintenance workers who are experienced in fixing such aircraft, as well as meaning a lack of potential replacements in event of a full breakdown, he explains.

“There is no economic case to keep the entire fleet pipeline available for the aircraft, which is now down to a few dozen in service in the world,” Singh says.

Once known as the “flying Taj Mahal”, the Airbus A310 is now only left with three of Iran’s carriers and one of Afghanistan’s carriers – and both nations face heavy sanctions, making it tough for them to upgrade to newer, wide-body aircraft.

When faced with technical and mechanical glitches, heads of state, in cases like Trudeau’s, cannot simply hitch a ride back with another leader or jump on a flight going to the same destination, says Mark Martin, founder and chief executive of Martin Consulting, a consultancy that focuses on aviation and defence.

“A lot of times aircraft break. They face issues with one of the million parts. Can they still fly? Yes, but this is being flown by the military, which will have to ensure safety is not compromised even in the smallest terms,” he tells The Independent.

Canada’s National Defence said the issue involved a part that must be replaced, without disclosing what the faulty item was.

“The safety of all passengers is critical to the RCAF and pre-flight safety checks are a regular part of all of our flight protocols,” it said, adding that discovery of the issue shows protocols are effective.

A government source told CBC that while the part was not fundamental to flying the plane, it is needed to meet regulations. The plane, thus, could not fly without it while carrying Trudeau.

“There are tons of security threats and technical issues, the teams of state heads can detect any security breach in pre-flight check when the world leaders have to leave and tell them to hold back if there is an issue. It can be simply contamination of food or fuel, when they record moisture content on a higher side than standard in fuel,” he says.

“The Royal Canadian Air Force can then tell Trudeau that the plane cannot be flown till all regulations are met, and some nations like Canada take it highly seriously,” says Mr Martin.

Singh says issues like this are frequent with Germany and Canada that still fly outdated aircraft from the 1980s and 1990s, but not with the US, that has the monstrous Boeing 747 for its president.

“Case in point, the US’s Air Force One aka Boeing 747 used by Joe Biden. The Head of State mission is taken highly seriously by the US Air Force, no one else commands that level of security and the elaborate procedures needed to keep them moving around the world,” he says.

“On the market side of it, the 747 has been an incredibly popular aircraft. The global use of 747 has made it easier for upkeep and availability of spare parts. We can’t fly in a 310, but still do in a 747,” he points out.

“It is simply coincidental. No one is going to dispatch an aircraft assuming that it won’t be able to take and bring your head of state back. When Trudeau left Canada, his team did so knowing that the Airbus A310-300 was in perfect shape,” Singh says.",Resume278,[],2023-09-14 08:25:12+00:00,"['aircraft', 'fly', 'leaders', '747', 'plane', 'state', 'force', 'world', 'breaking', 'air', 'planes', 'airbus', 'defence', 'trudeau']",the_independent_articles

Rishi Sunak received a warm and colourful welcome as he arrived in Delhi for the G20 leaders’ summit on Friday, the first visit to India in history by a British prime minister of Indian heritage.

Accompanied by his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of India’s billionaire Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murty, they were received at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport by the Indian minister for consumer affairs and environment, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, as well as British High Commissioner to New Delhi Alex Ellis.

Mr Sunak was not greeted on the airport tarmac by his Indian counterpart – perhaps understandable, given Narendra Modi is hosting the gathering of some 30 world leaders this weekend and holding bilateral talks on the sidelines with 15 of them.

And there were no thronging crowds to meet Mr Sunak either: despite excitement in India at the idea of a British-Indian resident of No 10 visiting the country of his ancestors, Delhi has been strictly locked down to ensure security during the G20, and the streets throughout the city were largely deserted on Friday.

As they stepped down from their RAF Voyager plane, Mr Sunak and Ms Murty were greeted instead by a traditional dance performance, and the moment was captured in rolling news coverage across the nation’s TVs.

India Today’s anchor Shiv Aroor hailed their arrival – referring to Ms Murty as “the first lady of the United Kingdom” – and noted excitedly: “Both are Desi (South Asian), both are Indians, and this is a very special relationship that the two leaders [Sunak and Modi] are going to be taking forward.

“There is a great amount of interest in the Indian-origin British prime minister arriving in India,” he added on behalf of his viewers.

“A big moment,” said NDTV anchor Gargi Rawat. “UK prime minister of Indian heritage. His wife is accompanying him, Akshata Murty, who is actually born in India, grew up in India. She is the daughter of one of India’s richest men.

“So, a lot of interest around the UK prime minister’s visit here.”

Reporters also repeatedly noted Mr Sunak’s religious identity as the first Hindu prime minister of the UK.

“Remember, it made headlines across the country the moment he said ‘Jai Siya Ram’ (Hail God Ram and Goddess Sita) when he was at Cambridge University”, said India Today reporter Gaurav Sawant, in an apparent reference to Mr Sunak’s remarks at a Jesus College event on India’s Independence Day.

After their car left the airport, Mr Sunak and Ms Murty were taken to meet local schoolchildren at the British Council headquarters in Delhi.

There they met children taking part in UK-funded programmes that support computer coding and language skills, according to pool reporters travelling with Mr Sunak.

Rishi Sunak was heard asking the school children whether they watched India’s successful Moon landing – last month India became the first country in history to achieve a successful soft landing on the Moon’s uncharted south pole with the Chandrayaan-3 mission.

After getting a fulsome reply, he said: “That was really cool, wasn’t it? A special moment.”

Akshata Murty interacted with the children and their coding projects before posing for photos with teachers and other staff.

The couple also joined a group of children who told them about a favourite book they were reading, with one 14-year-old picking William Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

After the British Council visit, Mr Sunak gave a brief interview to the broadcast media, in which he described his own excitement at returning as prime minister to “a country that’s near and dear to me”.

“I’m here as a British prime minister and my story is not that dissimilar from millions of British people, that living bridge that exists between India and the UK. It’s very powerful,” he said. “It’s about those people-to-people links, those family links. And it speaks to the incredible tolerance and diversity of our country, a country that welcomed millions of people like my family, and here I am now representing the UK back in India.

“I think it says an enormous amount about our country that everyone can be really proud of.”

Among those excited about Mr Sunak’s trip in India are some of his more distant relatives on his mother’s side.

Gautam Dev Sood, described as Mr Sunak’s maternal uncle, has given several interviews to Indian media. He told news agency ANI: “We are very happy that he [Sunak] is coming to India. There is a great sense of excitement, and we are trying to assemble in Delhi if it is possible to meet him.”

Speaking to India Today, he said: “All family members are very excited about it and very happy he is coming to India after becoming prime minister.”

On the plane en route to India, Mr Sunak said the trip was “obviously special”. “I saw somewhere that I was referred to as India’s son-in-law, which I hope was meant affectionately. I’m excited to be back. It is nice to have Akshata with me as well.”

Mr Sunak is scheduled to meet his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Saturday, and he wrote on social media after arriving in India on Friday that he was there to “[meet] world leaders to address some of the challenges that impact every one of us”.

The prime minister before his departure emphasised that he will focus on “stabilising the global economy” at the summit.

“I’m heading to the #G20 Summit with a clear focus. Stabilising the global economy. Building international relationships. Supporting the most vulnerable. This action is part of that – Putin again has failed to show up for the G20 but we will show up with support for Ukraine,” he wrote on Twitter/X.

During his visit to Delhi, Mr Sunak will be staying at the five-star Shangri-La Hotel in central Connaught Place, along with the rest of his delegation from the UK, amid high security and restrictions for the national capital’s residents.

Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has declared a public holiday for the city lasting until Monday – most Saturdays are considered a day of work in India – directing all schools, government and private offices to remain shut. There are also strict traffic restrictions in the central New Delhi district, also known as the Lutyens Zone, where Mr Sunak will be staying, meaning only residents and those in essential service jobs are allowed to enter the area.",Resume279,[],2023-09-08 17:24:34+00:00,"['rishi', 'desi', 'minister', 'prime', 'british', 'soninlaw', 'wife', 'indian', 'india', 'country', 'sunak', 'akshata', 'welcomed', 'murty', 'mr', 'delhi']",the_independent_articles

Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of the electronics giant Foxconn, declared Monday that he will run as an independent candidate for president in Taiwan's 2024 election, ending months of speculation.

At a news conference, Gou criticized the governing Democratic Progressive Party, saying its policies have “brought Taiwan into the risk of war” with China, which claims the self-ruled island democracy as part of its territory.

He said Taiwan also needs new approaches on the economy and other matters at home. “Domestically, the national policy direction is filled with all sorts of mistakes. There’s no way to solve the difficulties of Taiwanese industry and people’s livelihoods,” he said.

Gou's Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is a major supplier to Apple and has factories in China.

He has long had presidential aspirations. He ran in the 2019 election but lost as Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party easily won re-election.

This time around, Gou initially sought to become the candidate for the Kuomingtang, the opposition party that is friendly to China. However, the party selected New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih as its candidate.

Gou said he felt he has something to contribute on the issues that matter to Taiwan's people.

“I have not seen substantive discussions of policy recently, especially on the topics of cross straits relations (with China), economic development or international relations ... ,” he said.

Gou said he would work as president for Taiwanese society’s unity, because unity was critical to Taiwan's future.",Resume281,[],2023-08-28 16:55:41+00:00,"['china', 'foxconn', 'gou', 'presidency', 'sign', 'terry', 'verifyerrors', 'taiwans', 'unity', 'candidate', 'valid', 'breaking', 'email', 'billionaire', 'independent', 'party', 'seek']",the_independent_articles

When British economist Jim O’Neill coined the “Bric” acronym about two decades ago to denote Brazil, Russia, India and China, he was writing about investment opportunities in nations set to become the world’s top emerging economies.

Then a Goldman Sachs banker, he did not think that the four countries will borrow his idea to form a transnational bloc eight years later in 2009.

Now, the five-member group of developing nations has agreed to expand the alliance further to include Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and United Arab Emirates in a bid to provide a counterweight to the dominance of Western alliances in global affairs.

""This membership expansion is historic,"" Chinese president Xi Jinping, the bloc’s most stalwart proponent of the enlargement, said. ""It shows the determination of Brics countries for unity and cooperation with the broader developing countries.""

The six new candidates will formally become members on 1 January 2024, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said when he named the countries during a three-day leaders’ summit he is hosting in Johannesburg.

""Brics has embarked on a new chapter in its effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous,"" Ramaphosa said.

""We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process and other phases will follow.""

The expansion adds economic heft to Brics whose current members are China – the world’s second-largest economy – as well as Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa.

The move is also aimed at increasing Brics’s clout as a champion of so-called Global South nations, many of which feel unfairly treated by international institutions dominated by the United States and other wealthy Western nations, explains professor Swaran Singh, an international relations professor at India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University.

“Expansion of Brics or Brics were never meant for challenging any other system,” he says.

“They were supposed to create an alternative platform to provide some opportunity for least developed and developing countries to participate in international decision making, which automatically perhaps indirectly implies that there is some discomfort with the way international decision making has happened inside the post-second World War international organizations,” he tells The Independent.

“And therefore they were presenting an alternative to create space for these developing countries. And if it is expanding, that means that there is an increasing desire and demand in the world for a platform like this.”

More than 40 countries expressed interest in joining Brics, with 22 formally asking, representing a disparate pool of potential candidates – from Iran to Argentina – motivated largely by a desire to level a global playing field many consider rigged against them.

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres also attended Thursday’s expansion announcement, reflecting the bloc’s growing influence as he echoed its longstanding calls for reforms of the UN Security Council, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.

""Today’s global governance structures reflect yesterday’s world,"" he said. ""For multilateral institutions to remain truly universal, they must reform to reflect today’s power and economic realities.""

And while the criteria for inclusion of new members remains unclear, those invited to join the bloc reflect individual Brics members’ desires to bring allies into the club.

Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had vocally lobbied for neighbour Argentina’s inclusion while Egypt has close commercial ties with Russia and India. The entry of oil powers Saudi Arabia and UAE highlights their drifting away from the United States’s orbit and ambition to become global heavyweights in their own right.

Russia and Iran have found common cause in their shared struggle against US-led sanctions and diplomatic isolation. With their economic ties deepening in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin used his address to lambast the West, highlight the threat they posed to traditional values in developing nations, and signal the emergence of a multi-polar world.

""Make no mistake: this is not just about trade,” says Daniel Silke, director of the South Africa-based Political Futures consultancy. “This is about the fragmentation and political polarisation we are seeing in the world,"" he notes, adding that China had cited threats of a new Cold War with Washington as a reason to expand.

""The world... has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,"" Xi said on Wednesday. ""We, the Brics countries, should always bear in mind our founding purpose of strengthening ourselves through unity.""

But Singh argues that while the individual countries may have their own national agenda when they address the Brics, “when it comes to collective, the declaration and the tone is much generic”.

“It’s not appearing at all as anti-West. It seeks reforms in the IMF. That is a fair thing that they have been talking about democratizing International institutions.”

“But of course, Iran and Russia would be looking at Brics as their platform if they are getting isolated. This will be the collective which they will kind of depend on.

“So I can understand that Tehran and Moscow would have a very different take on how they see their participation in Brics.

“But overall, Brics is able to balance the tone and you have seen moderation in the final declaration which doesn’t kind of become jingoistic exactly the way Russia would like it to be or Iran would like it to be.

“And of course, Russia, China, India have always said we oppose unilateral sanctions on Iran. So in that sense, you can see the same tone in the final declaration.”

Though home to about 40 per cent of the world’s population and a quarter of global gross domestic product, internal divisions have long hobbled Brics ambitions of becoming a major player on the world stage.

Brics countries have economies that are vastly different in scale and governments with often divergent foreign policy goals. And as a result, the West does not really see Brics as a serious threat to western blocs.

It was evident in the statement by White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan last Tuesday who noted that Washington does not see them as ""evolving into some kind of geo-political rival to the United States or anyone else"" due to divergence on critical issues.

The view is not unsubstantiated.

Its heavyweight members – China and India – are often at odds: New Delhi is more friendly to the West and has military deals with the United States, while it is in sometimes violent conflict with Beijing over their Himalayan border.

For Russian president Vladimir Putin the bloc is a forum to jab at the West that has sought to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Lula used the summit to reiterate Brazil’s position of ""defending sovereignty (and) territorial integrity"" of countries, in an apparent swipe at Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

“I doubt that an expanded Brics can pose any real challenge to existing blocs - Brics has always been incoherent politically speaking – while the Russians and Chinese have had a clear anti-West agenda, India and the rest do not necessarily see the world this way,” says Jabin Thomas Jacob, an associate professor specialising in China’s domestic politics and foreign relations at New Delhi’s Shiv Nadar University.

“India has issues with Western economic domination but it is much closely aligned with the West on matters of international law and norms than it is with China or Russia.

“The Brics countries might look like they have taken a neutral stance on the Russian invasion but there are differences between them,” says Jabin. “Clearly, China is much more invested in a Russian victory while the others are much more concerned about a quick end to the conflict and disruption in the grain and energy markets.”

Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, are holding a joint press conference, with the NATO candidate offering ‘condolences’ for the ongoing Russian invasion.

“Not only do our flags have the same colours...but the relationships between our two countries go back hundreds of years”, Kristersson said during his opening statement.

It’s the first time Zelensky has visited the country since the invasion began in early 2022.

On his trip, the pair have reportedly had discussion about how ‘Sweden and the rest of the world’ can ‘support’ Ukraine going forward.

Kristersson reminded listeners that Sweden has already sent 2.2 billion euros worth of support to the country, and will continue its military support, including providing ‘spare parts and ammunition’.

Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of the electronics giant Foxconn, declared Monday that he will run as an independent candidate for president in Taiwan's 2024 election, ending months of speculation.

At a news conference, Gou criticized the governing Democratic Progressive Party, saying its policies have “brought Taiwan into the risk of war” with China, which claims the self-ruled island democracy as part of its territory.

He said Taiwan also needs new approaches on the economy and other matters at home. “Domestically, the national policy direction is filled with all sorts of mistakes. There’s no way to solve the difficulties of Taiwanese industry and people’s livelihoods,” he said.

Gou's Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is a major supplier to Apple and has factories in China.

He has long had presidential aspirations. He ran in the 2019 election but lost as Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party easily won re-election.

This time around, Gou initially sought to become the candidate for the Kuomingtang, the opposition party that is friendly to China. However, the party selected New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih as its candidate.

Gou said he felt he has something to contribute on the issues that matter to Taiwan's people.

“I have not seen substantive discussions of policy recently, especially on the topics of cross straits relations (with China), economic development or international relations ... ,” he said.

Gou said he would work as president for Taiwanese society’s unity, because unity was critical to Taiwan's future.",Resume284,[],2023-08-28 16:55:41+00:00,"['china', 'foxconn', 'gou', 'presidency', 'sign', 'terry', 'verifyerrors', 'taiwans', 'unity', 'candidate', 'valid', 'breaking', 'email', 'billionaire', 'independent', 'party', 'seek']",the_independent_articles

When British economist Jim O’Neill coined the “Bric” acronym about two decades ago to denote Brazil, Russia, India and China, he was writing about investment opportunities in nations set to become the world’s top emerging economies.

Then a Goldman Sachs banker, he did not think that the four countries will borrow his idea to form a transnational bloc eight years later in 2009.

Now, the five-member group of developing nations has agreed to expand the alliance further to include Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and United Arab Emirates in a bid to provide a counterweight to the dominance of Western alliances in global affairs.

""This membership expansion is historic,"" Chinese president Xi Jinping, the bloc’s most stalwart proponent of the enlargement, said. ""It shows the determination of Brics countries for unity and cooperation with the broader developing countries.""

The six new candidates will formally become members on 1 January 2024, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said when he named the countries during a three-day leaders’ summit he is hosting in Johannesburg.

""Brics has embarked on a new chapter in its effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous,"" Ramaphosa said.

""We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process and other phases will follow.""

The expansion adds economic heft to Brics whose current members are China – the world’s second-largest economy – as well as Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa.

The move is also aimed at increasing Brics’s clout as a champion of so-called Global South nations, many of which feel unfairly treated by international institutions dominated by the United States and other wealthy Western nations, explains professor Swaran Singh, an international relations professor at India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University.

The threat of a nuclear catastrophe is “great and growing” under the current global political environment, over 100 top medical journals have warned in a joint editorial.

Current efforts to control nuclear arms, as well as those for non-proliferation are “inadequate” to protect the world’s population against the threat of nuclear war, the editors of the journals warned, while pointing to the danger underlined by growing tensions between many nuclear armed states.

“As editors of health and medical journals worldwide, we call on health professionals to alert the public and our leaders to this major danger to public health and the essential life support systems of the planet – and urge action to prevent it,” the editors of journals like Lancet, BMJ, JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine said in the op-ed.

They also warned of the increasing risk of rapid escalation with the modernisation of nuclear arsenals by many countries, including China and the US.

Citing an example, the editors noted that hypersonic missiles under constant development by many countries decrease the time available to distinguish between an attack and a false alarm.

“Any use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic for humanity,” they said.

“Even a ‘limited’ nuclear war involving only 250 of the 13,000 nuclear weapons in the world could kill 120 million people outright and cause global climate disruption leading to a nuclear famine, putting two billion people at risk,” the editorial said.

Once a nuclear weapon is detonated in any part of the world, escalation to an all-out nuclear war can occur rapidly.

They called for the prevention of any use of nuclear weapons as an urgent public health priority, adding that fundamental steps be taken to abolish all nuclear weapons.

The editors called on health professional associations worldwide to support efforts urging the adoption of a “no first use policy” and urge all states currently involved in conflicts to publicly and unequivocally pledge that they will not use nuclear weapons in these conflicts.

“The danger is great and growing. The nuclear armed states must eliminate their nuclear arsenals before they eliminate us,” they wrote.",Resume288,[],2023-08-03 09:22:44+00:00,"['warn', 'nuclear', 'sign', 'growing', 'great', 'catastrophe', 'verifyerrors', 'weapons', 'medical', 'health', 'public', 'war', 'editors', 'threat', 'warned', '100', 'journals']",the_independent_articles

A daredevil who fell 68 floors to his death shared photos of the sky-high buildings he loved to climb in his final Instagram posts.

Remi Lucidi, 30, was climbing the Tregunter Tower complex in Hong Kong when he fell to his death, reportedly becoming trapped outside a penthouse.

In a picture posted to Instagram on 16 July, Mr Lucidi posed for a selfie whilst hanging off the stairs at the top of a large building in Gabrovo, Bulgaria. The caption eerily read: “Life is too short to chase unicorns.”

Just one week ago, he posted what would be his last photo of the Hong Kong skyline, accompanied by the caption “Hong Kong” with a love heart emoji.

Having started his endeavours as a stuntman in 2016, earlier posts depict his views from the tops of towering buildings across the likes of Dubai, Bangkok and Warsaw. With 12.8K followers, many of his selfies see him clinging to building spires without any protective gear.

Geotagged in Malaysia, a post from February - in celebration of his 30th birthday and marked with a cake emoji - shows him smiling amidst a sunny background and a leafy green forest.

When he arrived at the Tregunter Tower complex, Mr Lucidi told security that he was visiting a friend on the 40th floor. According to Hong Kong officials, his claim was challenged but the stuntman quickly caught a lift before they could properly cross-examine his excuse.

The South China Morning Post reported that, after reaching the 68th floor, he began frantically knocking on a window. Startling a maid inside, he lost his footing and fell shortly afterwards.

However, an official statement and the cause of death have not yet been released by the authorities in Hong Kong.

Populated with videos of extreme sports, Mr Lucidi’s sports camera was found at the scene. He had been staying at a hostel in Tsim Sha Tsui, with the owner, Gurjit Kaur, later telling the Post that the 30-year-old “healthy and fit and happy faced.”

""He told me he was going to hike a mountain when I asked where he was going. He said he wanted to hike a lot when he was here”, Mr Kaur added, noting that he felt “very sad” at the news of his death.

Mr Lucidi’s social media has now become inundated with tributes. His last photo, taken from Times Square in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, has seen Instagram users wishing him “eternal respect.”

“Lived his life to the fullest always seeking adventure, didn’t let fear get in the way,” one person wrote. “Life is truly short, rest easy brother...”

Shark attacks can be a rare occurrence, but the BBC’s latest documentary ‘Why Sharks Attack’ has no doubt caught the eyes of many, sparking questions and fears of shark attacks while swimming in open waters.

During the filming of the show, a sudden shark attack took place at Sahl Hasheesh Resort in Eygpt in 2022. Elisabeth Sauer, 68, was named as the victim and was said to be snorkelling in shallow water less than two meters deep when she was bitten. Ms Sauer did not survive the attack and was pronounced dead before reaching the hospital.

This year, a 23-year-old Russian tourist named Vladimir Popov also lost his life after being mauled to death by a tiger shark off Eygpt’s Red Sea resorts.

Sharks attack humans when they mistake swimmers for seals, footage shows

Video footage of the man was taken from the beach appearing to show him screaming as the attack unfolded.

So far this year, there have been 46 publicly reported shark attacks, seven of which were fatal, according to TrackingSharks.com.

And so, the question remains - why do sharks attack humans? Here’s everything we know:

Why do sharks attack humans?

According to the Shark Research Institute, there are over 400 plus species of shark around the world, which include great white sharks, tiger sharks and bull sharks.

Roger Tabor, a biologist, naturalist and broadcaster, tells The Independent that the bull shark has been linked to an “increase in attacks on surfers in the USA”. He said these attacks are “not so likely to be fatal, but [the shark] will take limbs.”

Mr Tabor says the likelihood of being attacked by a shark is quite low and the risk of drowning is “some 4,000 times greater, and even being killed by a cow is more likely than by a shark, as is the way with statistics cows and waters are far more widespread across the landmass.”

However, there are certain areas which may have a higher shark population which therefore “increases the probability of contact”.

Shark attacks are often put into different categories: provoked and unprovoked. According to the Shark Attack Files, backed by Florida Museum, worldwide last year there were a total of 57 unprovoked shark bites on humans and 32 provoked bites.

The International Shark Attack files reported over 500 unprovoked shark attacks between 2010 and 2019.

“Unprovoked bites” are defined as incidents in which a bite on a human occurs in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark.

“Provoked bites” occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way. For instance, when divers are bitten after harassing or trying to touch sharks.

Mr Tabor tells The Independent: “There is no evidence to show that sharks specifically hunt people. Most sharks go for small prey, so it is only large species that have behaviour profile to attack larger prey, and specifically mammals.”

In a paper published by Eric Clua, a marine biologist and Carl Meyer, a biologist at the University of Hawaii, in the Brill Journal, they look at the Mistaken Identity Hypothesis (MIH).

The MIH theory interprets shark bikes on surfers, swimmers and snorkelers as “mistakes”, which typically means that sharks might confuse humans for their typical prey.

Mr Tabor says surfing has previously been linked to shark attacks due to the “sudden movement, similar to an animal suddenly retreating, or bright parts of wetsuits reflecting looking like a fish or similar in itself, can cause a response in the visually oriented great white.”

The paper says that although MIH may now be “widely” accepted by the general public and the scientific community, there are still some unknown gaps.

“This hypothesis assumes that ‘mistaken’ shark bites on humans result primarily from confusing visual cues and ignores the important role of other senses (e.g. hearing) in discriminating potential prey,” the paper says.

However, the authors of the paper also note that shark bites which occur in clear water cannot always be explained by MIH. It adds: “Simply stated, sharks don’t make ‘mistakes’ but instead continually explore their environments and routinely investigate novel objects as potential prey by biting them.”

In 1984, Timothy Tricas and John McCosker, authors of the paper Predatory Behaviour of the White Shark, note that “shark attacks the surfer because it mistakes his silhouette for that of a seal,” giving more weight to the MIH theory.

But Mr Clua and Mr Meyer argue that the “MIH remains at best an unproven hypothesis.”

Global warming and habitat damage

Mr Tabor tells The Independent that climate change may be the reason for seeing an increase in shark attacks.

He says: “People are very recent on the planet compared to sharks. Humans, 2 million years, even the ancestor of chimps and ourselves only takes it back to 6 million years ago, while sharks go back an incredible 450 million years. Seals only go back 23-24 million years and dolphins/porpoises go back twice that, not as much as sharks, but they have shared the seas a lot longer than ourselves with sharks”.

Mr Tabor adds that marine mammals “spend much more time in the sea than we do on beaches, so are far more likely to be prey,” and so, “global warming and habitat damage can move marine species including seal group & sharks. That can bring larger sharks more into contact with beaches with people, (as they have been for longer with seals).”

The Flordia Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has put out advice on how people can protect themselves and reduce the chances of getting bitten - it says:

Stay in groups since sharks are more likely to bite if you are alone

Do not wander far into the water - especially without assistance

Avoid entering the water with an open wound if you are menstruating as sharks can often smell blood

Swim in areas tended by lifeguards

Do not enter the water in areas where it is known that sharks are present

Dr James Lea, CEO of the Save Our Seas Foundation tells The Independent the chances of being bitten are incredibly low, but if and when they do happen the “vast majority of bites are non-fatal, but they can of course have tragic consequences.”

Therefore, Dr Lea says: “It’s always important to be aware of risks when using waters where you may encounter sharks, and there are a few things you can do to help reduce any risk of a negative interaction.

“It’s important to swim where lifeguards are on watch, or if you have them any local programmes like Shark Spotters - they can help raise the alarm if needed and help is on hand. Swimming in groups can reduce risk, and try not to swim near diving birds or schools of fish - predators like sharks may have herded them nearshore to feed.”

Dr Lea also says people should try and avoid swimming at “dawn and dusk - these are often times sharks are actively hunting as they take advantage of low light conditions.

“Make sure you don’t swim near any fishing activity, especially if they are using bait. Things like not having or covering lots of shiny jewellery can also help, as a lot of sharks are quite visual predators looking for shiny fish.”

And last but not least, “don’t stray too far from shore, and avoid excess splashing,” Dr Lea adds.",Resume292,[],2023-07-20 19:25:57+00:00,"['bites', 'tabor', 'water', 'attack', 'shark', 'attacks', 'humans', 'sharks', 'paper', 'prey']",the_independent_articles

President Joe Biden on Wednesday hailed the “unbroken” people of Ukraine and the “incredible dignity” with which they’ve acted to repel Russia’s invading forces as he pledged on behalf of the Western world to maintain support for Kyiv’s defence for as long as necessary.

Mr Biden delivered his remarks to a boisterous crowd who’d gathered hours ahead of time to hear him speak in the Great Court at Vilnius University, following the conclusion of this year’s Nato leaders’ summit, at which leaders of the 31-member defence alliance agreed to expedite Ukraine’s bid for membership in the bloc once the war with Russia has been brought to a close.

The president, who was also met with one person in the crowd who held a sign marking him as a supporter of his predecessor, Donald Trump, noted the history of the place where he was speaking, and recalled how the Lithuanian yellow, green and red tricolour flag remained aloft outside the country’s diplomatic mission to Washington, even throughout the Soviet occupation of Lithuania.

He said some of the older attendees in the crowd would “know better than anyone how precious the right to determine your own future is,” and praised Lithuania and the other Baltic states — Estonia and Latvia — for their strenuous advocacy for Ukraine’s defence and for Kyiv’s bid for membership in Nato.

Mr Biden said that all parties involved “want this war to end,” but only on terms that will “uphold the basic principles” of the UN charter concerning national sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling those concepts “two pillars of peaceful relations among nations”.

“One country cannot be allowed to seize his neighbour territory by force,” he said, adding that Moscow “could end this war tomorrow” by pulling back Russian forces from all of Ukraine’s territory, with the caveat that Moscow “has shown thus far no interest” in such an outcome because Russian president Vladimir Putin “still wrongly believes that he can outlast Ukraine”.

“He can't believe it's their land, their country and their future and even after all this time, Putin still doubts their staying power,” Mr Biden said, adding that the Russian leader is “still making a bad bet” by thinking that the “conviction and the unity among the United States and our allies and partners will break down”.

“He still doesn't understand that our commitment, our values, our freedom is something he can never, never, ever ever walk away from. It's who we are,” he said.

“The defence of freedom is not the work of a day or a year. It's the calling of our lifetime — of all time. We’re steeled for the struggle ahead, our unity will not falter, I promise you”.

Mr Biden added that the US and Western commitment to Ukraine’s defence “will not waver”.

“Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes,” he said.

The president’s remarks echoed another rousing speech he delivered in Warsaw five months ago, when he pledged “unwavering” support for Ukraine’s defence and Nato’s unity less than 24 hours after a surprise visit to Kyiv.

At the time, he pledged that Ukraine “will never be a victory for Russia,” and it appears that the rest of the West is on board with Mr Biden’s plans.

In addition to the Nato leaders who gathered in Vilnius this week, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida travelled there to unveil a new joint declaration from the Group of Seven in support of Kyiv’s defence.

In remarks delivered following the G7 leaders’ session, Mr Biden said the joint declaration will “make it clear” that support for Kyiv from the world’s largest democracies “will last long into the future”.

“This starts a process by which each of our nations and any other nation who wishes to participate will negotiate long-term bilateral or security commitments with him to Ukraine. We’re going to help Ukraine build a strong capable defence across land, air and sea ... which will enforce stability in the region and deter against any and all threats,” he said.

Mr Biden reiterated the same sentiment a short time later during a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.

He praised Mr Zelensky, the actor-turned-politician who has served as Ukraine’s leader since 2019, as having “done an enormous job” and promised that the US and its allies would “make sure that you get what you need”.

“And I look forward to the day when we’re having the meetings celebrating your official membership in Nato, so thank you for what you’re doing,” he said.

For his part, Mr Zelensky thanked the US president for his recent decision to provide Kyiv with cluster munitions for use against Russian troops on Ukrainian soil, telling Mr Biden that the move “will help us to save us”.

The announcement of the joint declaration and the meeting between Mr Biden and Mr Zelensky came after days of tension between the Ukrainian leader and his other Western counterparts over Ukraine’s prospects for membership in Nato.

While the US and many other Nato nations had been skittish about giving Ukraine a path to rapid membership while the war with Russia continues, other states have pushed for an immediate change in Kyiv’s status.

But the joint declaration — and an announcement from Nato that Ukraine could skip the Membership Action Plan previously laid out for the country’s membership bid and join at a future date post-war — appeared to smooth over the tension between the allies and the Ukrainian leader. Asked how long it would take for Nato to accept Ukraine once the war was over, Mr Biden quipped: “An hour and 20 minutes”.",Resume293,[],2023-07-12 19:09:09+00:00,"['spirited', 'membership', 'mr', 'unbroken', 'biden', 'ukraines', 'president', 'email', 'nato', 'ukraine', 'war', 'trump', 'speech', 'fan', 'defence', 'ukrainian', 'crowd', 'hails']",the_independent_articles

Was it the preposterous royal boasts? The possible threat to nesting turtles? Or simply local resistance to yet another foreign developer cherry-picking a choice parcel of land that has created such a storm on the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda?

The extraordinary six-year battle has featured tales of a holidaying Princess Diana, accusations of playing Russian roulette with islanders’ futures and a devastating hurricane.

At the centre of the row lies ambitious plans to build a 15,000 square foot villa complex set in 114 acres, equipped with multiple swimming pools, guesthouse, tennis courts, gym and staff quarters – as well as a “security buffer zone” to keep away prying eyes.

But the project spearheaded by 42-year-old Henry Anderson, with his cut-glass English accent and penchant for over-dressing in a hot climate, has enraged many on the 62 square-mile slice of paradise.

The scheme has become entangled in disputes with the country’s central government, local councils, environmental experts and international human rights advocates – even Buckingham Palace has got involved.

The Independent has sought to unravel truth from fiction by speaking to key players, including local decision makers, legal experts, Mr Anderson and the royal family.

The royal link

Mr Anderson did not hold back in mentioning royal connections when first proposing his multi-million-pound project, located at Cedar Tree Point in the protected area of Codrington Lagoon National Park, in 2017.

Arthur Nibbs, chair of Barbuda Council when Mr Anderson initially sought approval, said he gave the green light because he believed the property was for royalty.

“What was put forward was that they’re going to be building some villas for the Queen and so on,” he told The Independent.

“They wanted a property that could accommodate the royals whenever they come to Barbuda. For me that went a long way because we didn’t want to have any large-scale development for mass tourism.”

Jackie Frank, a former Barbuda councillor, recalled how Mr Anderson freely bandied about the names of the princes who came to Barbuda with Princess Diana in the Nineties.

“He constantly talked about how good it would be to have the two princes back. It became clear that he was talking about Prince William and Prince Harry. What he was wanting, he said, was to start building a property for the princes,” Ms Frank said.

“He repeatedly mentioned a gentleman called Lord Abercorn who works for or with the Queen.”

The 5th Duke of Abercorn, James Hamilton, 88, is said to have been an old friend of the late Queen. King Charles is also godfather to his son James, Marquess of Hamilton.

The Cedar Tree Point land was leased to Mr Anderson’s company, which he named Abercorn Trust Incorporated, registered in Antigua and Barbuda.

Royal family connections carry weight on Barbuda, part of a Commonwealth country with its larger, wealthier sister island of Antigua.

The Barbudans are proud of their history as one of Diana’s favourite holiday destinations and a beach is named after her just five miles from the planned villa. Prince Harry returned to Barbuda in 2016, one of his last solo royal tours. At the time, he fondly recalled how he and Prince William holidayed with their mother in the secluded destination in April 1997, a few months before she died.

But Mr Anderson’s bid went beyond royal name-dropping.

Part of the land lease – dated, stamped and lodged with the Antigua and Barbuda central government – includes a document titled “Lease of Land for the Construction of a Residence for the Royal Family of Britain”.

It states: “Cabinet agreed that a parcel of land on the island of Barbuda measuring approximately 16 acres should be identified and leased for the purpose of constructing a residence for the Royal Family of Britain.”

Buckingham Palace was somewhat bemused by the claim. Contacted by The Independent, a palace spokesperson denied all knowledge of Mr Anderson and his Barbuda development, adding: “This is not a name or a property that we recognise”.

Similarly the Duke of Abercorn told The Independent that he has “no knowledge of, or connection to, Henry Anderson” and that “this is the first” he has heard of “any such development” and that he “has no property interests in Barbuda”.

When The Independent approached Mr Anderson, he blamed an unnamed contractor for filing the misleading court document, but insisted the royal link was genuine.

“Mr Anderson’s intention has always been to build a private residence for his own use on Barbuda which, given the holidays they enjoyed on the island, would be offered to certain members of the Royal Family to use on occasion if they so wished,” his spokesperson said.

“At no time has Mr Anderson claimed that this project was authorised by Buckingham Palace and the document referred to which mentioned the Royal Family was submitted early on in the project by a contractor without his knowledge. He has been perfectly clear with all parties involved that the idea of offering use of the property to members of the Royal Family was simply meant as a gesture that might or might not be taken up.”

The developer and his challengers

Beyond royalty, Mr Anderson, who lives in a £3.6m terraced home in South Kensington, has found himself at odds with vocal opponents on Barbuda, who say his development threatens turtle nesting sites, a rare colony of magnificent frigatebirds and has compromised hurricane and flood defences of the island.

Despite coming across as well-spoken and expensively-dressed, his charm, described by the Barbudans who met him, was put to the test last September after a barge carrying construction equipment ran aground on the beach at the site.

In a feisty exchange with the Barbuda Council, Mr Anderson was berated for seeking to develop his project in the Codrington national park.

Among them was environmental expert and councillor John Mussington who said: “Would you allow something to be opened up in the River Thames that is going to flood the city?”

Mr Mussington cited several environmental groups, such as the Caribbean Conservation Association and Birds Caribbean, whom he said objected to the plan.

Another councillor lambasted Mr Anderson: “We are advising you not to play Russian roulette with the lives of people of Barbuda.”

Insisting his plans were “environmentally safe” and would not affect a local bird sanctuary, he told councillors: “I am an ornithologist and have been a member of the RSPB since I was six. I love the frigate birds.

“I’m not a massive corporation. Please, please trust me. I am a good guy. I am not a massive developer. I fell in love with this island. I would not want to destroy it.”

His words did little to appease the Barbuda Council or the Department of Environment (DoE).

At the end of the meeting, the council said: “We’re not going to give any permission to build any structure out there. Stop now. You’re creating so much damage to the park and it’s going to cost millions to restore it.”

A DoE letter that same month reiterated their continued opposition to construction.

But Mr Anderson had national figures and agencies on his side including the country’s Development Control Authority (DCA) which approved his plans. Decisions of the DCA override those taken by the local Barbuda Council.

Power relations between the Barbuda council and central government are fraught, ever since a law which enshrined the Barbudan population with communal ownership of their island was changed in the wake of Hurricane Irma in 2017, and opened the door for a boom in luxury, foreign development.

The devastating storm killed three people, destroyed nearly every home and business on Barbuda and all 1,800 residents were evacuated to Antigua before being allowed to return.

Mr Anderson has been a beneficiary of this new direction. He has said he has obtained all approvals needed for his development including from Barbuda Council. His spokesperson said: “The suggestion that Mr Anderson does not care about the environment is false and misleading.

“The property is set 340ft back from the seafront without having caused any disturbance to wildlife. Great care has been taken in this respect and turtles and frigates will be completely unaffected. Indeed, The Barbuda Council’s claims about the alleged environmental impact of the project were withdrawn, and the council was ordered to pay Mr Anderson’s costs.”

However, the Barbuda Council dispute that all the appropriate approvals have been given. The Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a group of human rights lawyers providing support to Barbudans, told The Independent that further legal action is planned.

Spokesperson Dr Gearóid Ó Cuinn said: “Clearance of vegetation and mangrove inevitably impacts wildlife, as does driving heavy machinery across turtle nesting sites.”

The project – which Mr Anderson says is 90 per cent complete – continues. However photos, drone footage and video taken in May and June 2023, and shared with The Independent, reveal the shells of wooden buildings, exposed pilings, stacks of construction materials and heavy machinery at the site.

“Anyone visiting the construction site would be able to tell this is not correct,” Barbudan Gulliver Johnson told The Independent.

“The statement is clearly meant to discourage us by insinuating protests would be futile at this stage. We will not be fooled: we have seen the extent of environmental damage with our own eyes and we know what is yet to come. Our fight is not over.”",Resume294,[],2023-07-10 08:56:47+00:00,"['millionaire', 'connections', 'caribbean', 'barbuda', 'independent', 'anderson', 'legal', 'english', 'diana', 'property', 'island', 'project', 'council', 'princess', 'mr', 'royal', 'row']",the_independent_articles

Príncipe Harry pierde demanda ante Tribunal Superior sobre su seguridad,"Algunos reclamos del príncipe Harry contra tabloides podrían ir a juicio 0:43

(CNN) -- El príncipe Harry perdió un recurso judicial presentado contra la decisión del Gobierno del Reino Unido de despojarlo de la protección financiada por los contribuyentes tras abandonar sus funciones reales.

Harry emprendió acciones legales contra el Ministerio del Interior después de que este decidiera, en febrero de 2020, que ya no recibiría el “mismo grado” de protección cuando estuviera en el país.

Durante una audiencia en diciembre, los abogados de Harry argumentaron que la decisión significaba que había sido ""señalado"" y tratado ""menos favorablemente"", informó la agencia de noticias británica PA Media.

Según la agencia de noticias, sus abogados también citaron la falta de consideración del impacto en la reputación del Reino Unido de un “ataque exitoso” contra Harry, quien vive con su esposa Meghan en California desde julio de 2020.

Pero el tribunal dictaminó que la decisión estaba justificada y “no estaba empañada por injusticia procesal”.

El duque de Sussex ha expresado su opinión sobre la seguridad de su familia, y a menudo hace comparaciones entre el trato que recibió su esposa y el que enfrentó su madre, Diana. La fallecida princesa de Gales murió en 1997 tras sufrir lesiones internas como consecuencia de un accidente automovilístico a alta velocidad en París.

Este caso legal fue uno de varios juicios que el príncipe Harry ha emprendido en el Reino Unido. En enero, abandonó una demanda por difamación que presentó contra Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), editora del diario Mail on Sunday.

El príncipe Harry demandó a la ANL por difamación por un artículo publicado en febrero de 2022 sobre la demanda del duque ante el Tribunal Supremo contra el Ministerio del Interior del Reino Unido en relación con las medidas de seguridad cuando él y su familia visitan el país.

Un portavoz legal del príncipe Harry dijo a Max Foster, de CNN: ""El duque de Sussex apelará la sentencia de hoy que rechaza su demanda de revisión judicial contra el órgano de toma de decisiones del Comité Ejecutivo para la Protección de la Realeza y las Personalidades Públicas (RAVEC), que incluye el Ministerio del Interior, la Casa Real y la Policía Metropolitana o Met"".

¿Qué problemas de salud ha tenido el papa Francisco?,"Los detalles de la salud del papa Francisco 1:30

(CNN Español) -- El papa Francisco ingresó este miércoles en el hospital Isola Tiberina Gemelli Isola después de la audiencia general, donde le hicieron algunas pruebas diagnósticas, informó la oficina de prensa del Vaticano. Luego de los exámenes, regresó a la Santa Sede.

El pontífice ha sufrido varios problemas de salud a lo largo de los años, desde una neumonía –por la que le debieron extirpar parte de un pulmón cuando era joven– hasta una operación por diverticulitis en 2021 y una operación abdominal este 2023.

Neumonía grave en la juventud

Cuando tenía 21 años, al papa le extirparon el lóbulo superior del pulmón después de una neumonía grave.

En los últimos años, ya como pontífice, a Francisco a menudo se le ha visto con un bastón y a veces incluso utiliza una silla de ruedas debido a dolores en su rodilla derecha.

El año pasado, canceló un viaje a la República Democrática del Congo y Sudán del Sur después de que los médicos le dijeran que podría perderse también un viaje posterior a Canadá a menos que accediera a someterse a 20 días más de terapia y reposo para su rodilla. Finalmente viajó a la República Democrática del Congo y a Sudán del Sur en febrero.

Francisco también padece diverticulitis, una enfermedad común que puede causar la inflamación o infección del colon. En 2021, le operaron para extirparle parte del colon.

Y en junio de 2023, el papa fue sometido a una operación abdominal por una hernia incisional lacerada. Poco antes había estado hospitalizado por una infección respiratoria.

Carta de renuncia firmada

En diciembre de 2022, Francisco reveló en una entrevista con el medio español ABC que ya había firmado su carta de renuncia para ser utilizada en caso de que sufra una ""discapacidad"".

Francisco dijo que escribió la carta hace varios años y se la entregó al entonces secretario de Estado del Vaticano, el cardenal Tarcisio Bertone, quien renunció en 2013.

“Ya he firmado mi renuncia. El secretario de Estado en ese momento era Tarcisio Bertone. Lo firmé y dije: 'Si sufriera una discapacidad por razones médicas o lo que sea, aquí está mi renuncia'"", dijo Francisco.

“No sé a quién le entregó esa carta el cardenal Bertone, pero se la entregué cuando era secretario de Estado”, dijo Francisco, y agregó que esta era la primera vez que hablaba públicamente sobre la existencia de la carta.

Francisco dijo que los papas Pablo VI y Pío XII también habían redactado, durante sus pontificados, cartas de renuncia en caso de una discapacidad permanente.

En 2013, el predecesor inmediato de Francisco, el papa Benedicto XVI, tomó la decisión casi sin precedentes de renunciar a su cargo, citando la ""edad avanzada"" como la razón y sorprendiendo al mundo.

Fue la primera vez que un papa renunciaba en casi 600 años. El último papa en dimitir fue Gregorio XII, quien en 1415 renunció para poner fin a una guerra civil dentro de la Iglesia en la que más de un hombre pretendía ser papa.

El lado derecho de la cara de Roba Abu Jibba ha desaparecido casi por completo: una herida profunda y sangrienta está donde debería estar su ojo.

La joven de 18 años, confundida y dolorida, yace en una camilla en el Hospital de los Mártires de Al-Aqsa en Deir al-Balah, en el centro de Gaza. Intenta explicar cómo llegó allí. Había estado refugiada con su familia durante dos meses en un almacén industrial en la calle Salaheddin, la principal carretera que recorre de norte a sur el enclave, nos explica, cuando fueron objeto de intensos bombardeos de parte del ejército israelí.

"Las fábricas norcoreanas que producen armas para Rusia están ""operando a plena capacidad"", dice Corea del Sur","Así es la nueva arma que Corea del Norte podría probar pronto 2:24

Seúl, Corea del Sur (CNN) -- Las fábricas de municiones de Corea del Norte están ""operando a plena capacidad"" para producir armas y proyectiles para Rusia, según el ministro de Defensa de Corea del Sur, mientras la devastadora guerra de Moscú en Ucrania llega a su tercer año.

La última estimación de Corea del Sur ofrece nuevas pistas sobre el papel crucial pero altamente secreto que está desempeñando Corea del Norte para ayudar a reabastecer la guerra de desgaste de Moscú en un momento en que la propia necesidad de Ucrania de reabastecimientos militares vitales está siendo obstaculizada por legisladores predominantemente republicanos en Washington.

Las armas y el equipo militar, que incluyen millones de proyectiles de artillería, se entregan a Rusia a cambio de envíos de alimentos y otras necesidades, dijo el lunes el ministro de Defensa de Corea del Sur, Shin Won-sik.

Desde agosto, Pyongyang ha enviado alrededor de 6.700 contenedores a Rusia, que podrían albergar más de 3 millones de proyectiles de artillería de 152 mm o más de 500.000 proyectiles de lanzacohetes múltiples de 122 mm, según el ministerio de Shin.

""Mientras las fábricas de armas de Corea del Norte (para exportaciones no rusas) operan al 30% de su capacidad debido a la escasez de materias primas y electricidad, las fábricas que producen armas y proyectiles de artillería para Rusia están funcionando a plena capacidad"", dijo Shin en una reunión con periodistas.

A cambio, los alimentos representan la mayor parte de los contenedores desde Rusia a Corea del Norte, y la situación del suministro de alimentos en la aislada nación asiática parece ser ""estable"", según el Ministerio de Defensa.

En una hoja informativa publicada el pasado viernes, el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos dijo que Corea del Norte ha entregado más de 10.000 contenedores de municiones o materiales relacionados a Rusia desde septiembre.

CNN se comunicó con el Ministerio de Defensa de Corea del Sur para solicitar comentarios sobre la estimación de Estados Unidos, pero aún no ha recibido respuesta.

Restos de componentes de misiles norcoreanos fueron fabricados en Estados Unidos 2:40

Las entregas llegan en un momento crucial en la guerra de Rusia contra Ucrania, con las fuerzas de Moscú llevando a cabo una serie de ofensivas a lo largo de las líneas del frente de casi 1.000 kilómetros en un intento de romper lo que el ex máximo general de Kyiv describió el año pasado como un ""punto muerto"".

Rusia necesita nuevos suministros de municiones y proyectiles para sostener su esfuerzo bélico de desgaste después de sufrir grandes pérdidas de hombres y equipos durante más de dos años de guerra. Ambas partes continúan intercambiando intensos disparos a diario, agotando los suministros de municiones.

El reciente avance de Moscú en Avdiivka, una ciudad que ha estado en primera línea desde que los separatistas respaldados por Rusia lanzaron una rebelión contra Kyiv en 2014, muestra la capacidad de Rusia para desgastar a las fuerzas ucranianas a pesar de sufrir grandes pérdidas debido a su gran tamaño, capacidad de enviar oleada tras oleada de tropas al campo de batalla y superioridad aérea.

Kyiv enfrenta desafíos en múltiples frentes, incluida la lucha con sus propias limitaciones de mano de obra y el hecho de que el suministro de municiones de Occidente comienza a agotarse.

El presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, y otros funcionarios ucranianos y occidentales han dicho que Avdiivka se perdió porque las tropas no tenían suficientes municiones para defenderla.

Zelensky dijo a CNN esta semana que ""millones"" podrían morir en Ucrania si los legisladores estadounidenses no aprueban la solicitud de ayuda de US$ 60.000 millones del presidente Joe Biden para Kyiv.

Sin la ayuda de Estados Unidos, Ucrania no sólo tendrá dificultades para lograr nuevos avances en el campo de batalla, sino que también le resultará difícil seguir defendiéndose este año, dijo Zelensky.

Preocupaciones por las armas de Corea del Norte a Rusia

Las entregas de municiones de Pyongyang a Moscú se han registrado desde justo antes de que el líder norcoreano Kim Jong Un se reuniera con su homólogo, el presidente Vladimir Putin, para una cumbre en septiembre en el lejano oriente de Rusia.

La reunión fue una señal clara de relaciones más estrechas entre las dos naciones, ya que ambos países enfrentan un aislamiento internacional por la invasión de Ucrania por parte de Moscú y el programa de armas nucleares y misiles balísticos de Pyongyang.

Corea del Norte, que ha enfrentado años de sanciones internacionales por su programa de armas nucleares, carece de todo, desde dinero en efectivo y alimentos hasta tecnología de misiles.

Los funcionarios de inteligencia en Washington están cada vez más preocupados por los crecientes vínculos entre Corea del Norte y Rusia, informó anteriormente CNN, y las implicaciones a largo plazo de lo que parece ser un nuevo nivel de asociación estratégica entre las dos naciones.

Desde esa cumbre, Corea del Norte probablemente haya proporcionado a Rusia ""millones de rondas de artillería"" durante el último año, según un informe publicado a principios de este mes por el inspector general del Pentágono.

En noviembre, el Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional (NIS) de Corea del Sur dijo que Pyongyang ha exportado más de un millón de proyectiles a Rusia en 10 envíos separados desde principios de agosto para apoyar su guerra en Ucrania.

Funcionarios estadounidenses han advertido previamente a Corea del Norte que ""pagará un precio"" si proporciona armas a Moscú para usarlas contra Ucrania.

La Casa Blanca confirmó el mes pasado que Rusia ha estado disparando misiles norcoreanos contra ciudades ucranianas.

Estados Unidos y sus aliados también están preocupados por la tecnología que Corea del Norte busca de Rusia a cambio de armamento.

Según dos funcionarios estadounidenses, Pyongyang está buscando tecnología que pueda mejorar sus capacidades satelitales y submarinas de propulsión nuclear, lo que podría mejorar significativamente las capacidades de Corea del Norte en áreas que el régimen rebelde no ha desarrollado completamente.",Resume308,['Melissa Velásquez Loaiza'],2024-02-28 00:00:00,"['el', 'producen', 'y', 'norcoreanas', 'operando', 'en', 'rusia', 'sur', 'norte', 'la', 'fábricas', 'para', 'las', 'del', 'plena', 'que', 'corea']",cnn_espana_articles

Desde esa cumbre, Corea del Norte probablemente haya proporcionado a Rusia ""millones de rondas de artillería"" durante el último año, según un informe publicado a principios de este mes por el inspector general del Pentágono.

En noviembre, el Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional (NIS) de Corea del Sur dijo que Pyongyang ha exportado más de un millón de proyectiles a Rusia en 10 envíos separados desde principios de agosto para apoyar su guerra en Ucrania.

Funcionarios estadounidenses han advertido previamente a Corea del Norte que ""pagará un precio"" si proporciona armas a Moscú para usarlas contra Ucrania.

La Casa Blanca confirmó el mes pasado que Rusia ha estado disparando misiles norcoreanos contra ciudades ucranianas.

Estados Unidos y sus aliados también están preocupados por la tecnología que Corea del Norte busca de Rusia a cambio de armamento.

Según dos funcionarios estadounidenses, Pyongyang está buscando tecnología que pueda mejorar sus capacidades satelitales y submarinas de propulsión nuclear, lo que podría mejorar significativamente las capacidades de Corea del Norte en áreas que el régimen rebelde no ha desarrollado completamente.",Resume309,['Melissa Velásquez Loaiza'],2024-02-28 00:00:00,"['el', 'producen', 'y', 'norcoreanas', 'operando', 'en', 'rusia', 'sur', 'norte', 'la', 'fábricas', 'para', 'las', 'del', 'plena', 'que', 'corea']",cnn_espana_articles
"Un pez pequeño puede hacer ruidos más fuertes que un elefante, según un nuevo estudio","Danionella cerebrum vive en aguas poco profundas frente a Myanmar. Senckenberg/Britz

(CNN) -- Según un nuevo estudio, una pequeña especie de pez que no mide más de 1,27 centímetros de largo es capaz de producir sonidos más fuertes que los de un elefante.

Danionella cerebrum, un pequeño pez translúcido que vive en aguas poco profundas frente a Myanmar, puede emitir ruidos de más de 140 decibeles, informa un equipo internacional de científicos en un comunicado de prensa publicado este martes.



""Esto es comparable al ruido que un ser humano percibe de un avión durante el despegue a una distancia de 100 metros y bastante inusual para un animal de tamaño tan diminuto"", dijo el autor del estudio Ralf Britz, ictiólogo del Museo de Historia Natural Senckenberg en Dresde, Alemania, en el comunicado de prensa.

Los animales grandes tienden a ser capaces de producir ruidos más fuertes que los pequeños, y los elefantes pueden emitir sonidos de hasta 125 decibelios con su trompa.

Sin embargo, algunos animales pequeños pueden hacer ruidos increíblemente fuertes para su tamaño, incluido el camarón mordedor, que usa sus garras para emitir sonidos que miden hasta 250 decibeles, agrega el comunicado.

También hay algunas especies de peces que hacen ruidos inusualmente fuertes, como el pez guardiamarina macho, que es capaz de emitir llamadas de apareamiento de hasta 130 decibeles, pero Danionella cerebrum parece ser única entre los peces.

Los investigadores utilizaron grabaciones de vídeo de alta velocidad, escáneres micro-CT y analizaron información genética para demostrar que los machos de la especie ""poseen un aparato generador de sonido único que incluye cartílago tamborilero, una costilla especializada y un músculo resistente a la fatiga"", informó la prensa. comunicado dijo.

Los peces hacen ruido al golpear el cartílago contra su vejiga natatoria, un órgano lleno de gas que les permite mantener la profundidad en el agua, lo que produce un pulso rápido.

Los pulsos de mayor frecuencia se produjeron comprimiendo la vejiga natatoria desde los lados izquierdo y derecho en un patrón alterno, mientras que los pulsos de menor frecuencia se crearon mediante compresiones unilaterales repetidas en el mismo lado del cuerpo.

""No se ha informado de que ningún otro pez utilice contracciones musculares unilaterales repetidas para producir sonido"", se lee en el estudio.

Walt Disney World aumentó los precios de las entradas para 2025,"Disney sigue aumentando sus precios 1:18

(CNN) -- Walt Disney World puso a la venta entradas para 2025 y los precios de muchas entradas han aumentado respecto a los precios de 2024. Algunos de los precios más bajos de boletos para un solo día y un solo parque aumentaron US$ 10 para 2025.

Por ejemplo, algunos boletos entre semana de finales de agosto en Disney's Animal Kingdom han pasado de $109 para boletos de 2024 a US$ 119 para 2025.

Otras entradas de un solo día para diferentes parques durante diferentes períodos también muestran aumentos con respecto a muchos precios de 2024.

Por ejemplo, un sábado de finales de abril, cuando la demanda es alta, Animal Kingdom costará 169 dólares en 2025, frente a US$ 164 en 2024.

Magic Kingdom también subió US$ 5, de US$ 184 a US$ 189, ese mismo fin de semana de finales de abril.

El precio máximo publicado de boletos para un solo día y un solo parque para 2025 es de US$ 189 a partir del 27 de febrero. Es el mismo precio máximo en 2024. Los precios de los boletos para noviembre y diciembre de 2025 aún no estaban disponibles al 27 de febrero.

Los precios de las opciones Park Hopper que permiten a los visitantes visitar varios parques el mismo día también han aumentado entre US$ 5 y US$ 10 para muchas fechas en 2025.

Este no es el primer aumento de precios en los parques de Disney en los últimos años.

Se implementaron dos aumentos en 2022 en Walt Disney World. Disneyland también ha aumentado los precios más de una vez recientemente.

Disney adopta un nuevo enfoque

La forma en que Walt Disney World está implementando sus últimos cambios de precios es nueva, según Don Munsil, que dirige el sitio web de viajes MouseSavers.com.

""En el pasado, Disney simplemente subía todos los precios de las entradas a la vez en lugar de implementar nuevos precios a medida que añadían nuevas fechas a su calendario"", dijo Munsil en un correo electrónico. “La última vez que los precios subieron, una fecha específica podría ser US$ 144 en un día, y luego, después del aumento de precio, esa misma fecha exacta ahora es US$ 151.

Estados Unidos reduciría sus fuerzas militares cerca de Medio Oriente,"En esta fotografía de agosto de 2023, el USS Bataan transita por el Mar Rojo. (Comando Central de las Fuerzas Navales de EE. UU./Reuters/Archivo)

(CNN) -- Se espera que una fuerza de respuesta rápida de los Infantes de Marina abandone el Mediterráneo oriental en las próximas semanas y regrese a Estados Unidos, según dos funcionarios de Defensa, en lo que supone una reducción significativa de las fuerzas estadounidenses en la región.

El grupo anfibio USS Bataan y la 26.ª Unidad Expedicionaria de los Infantes de Marina (MEU, por sus siglas en inglés) podrían comenzar a navegar hacia EE.UU. en marzo, dijo un funcionario, aunque por el momento no está claro cómo sería el cronograma exacto de la salida. El Pentágono aún podría mantener al grupo en la región si la situación se deteriora rápidamente.

Las fuerzas de respuesta rápida de los marines se desplegó por primera vez en julio y fue enviada a la región en octubre. Anteriormente se había ampliado para permanecer en el mar Mediterráneo oriental, como informó CNN. Capaces de llevar a cabo operaciones anfibias y ciertas acciones especiales, los marines también están entrenados para ayudar en operaciones de evacuación, una de las razones por las que fueron enviados a Gaza al comienzo de la guerra. Pero mientras la guerra se acerca a su quinto mes, la necesidad de evacuar a los ciudadanos estadounidenses no se ha materializado.

El Pentágono se negó a hacer comentarios.

Estados Unidos ha mantenido un portaaviones o un barco de asalto anfibio en el Mediterráneo oriental desde poco después de los ataques del 7 de octubre en Israel. Los buques de guerra tenían como objetivo disuadir a los representantes iraníes en la región, como Hezbollah en el Líbano, de la posibilidad de agravar la ya volátil situación y correr el riesgo de un conflicto regional más amplio.

Al menos por ahora, los representantes iraníes en la región han detenido sus ataques contra las fuerzas estadounidenses en Iraq y Siria. Después de un flujo constante de ataques tras el comienzo de la guerra de Gaza (las fuerzas estadounidenses fueron atacadas al menos 170 veces desde que comenzó la guerra), no ha habido un ataque contra fuerzas estadounidenses en más de tres semanas. El abrupto cese de las agresiones se produce después de que un ataque unidireccional con aviones no tripulados matara a tres miembros del servicio estadounidense e hiriera a aproximadamente 70 más en Jordania a finales de enero.

""Ciertamente celebramos que no haya habido ninguna agresión"", dijo la subsecretaria de prensa del Pentágono, Sabrina Singh, en una sesión informativa el jueves. ""Creo que enviamos un mensaje muy fuerte con nuestros ataques, y continuaremos haciéndolo si es necesario, y lo haremos en el momento y lugar que elijamos"".

El regreso previsto del USS Bataan significará que Estados Unidos no tendrá un buque de guerra capaz de operar aviones de combate en el Mediterráneo oriental por primera vez desde octubre. El grupo de Bataan incluye 4.000 marineros e infantes de marina (aproximadamente 2.000 de los cuales forman parte de la 26.ª MEU) y transporta más de 24 aviones de ala fija y rotatoria.

Estados Unidos todavía tiene un destructor de misiles guiados en el Mediterráneo oriental y otros buques de guerra cercanos que podrían enviarse a la región si fuera necesario. El grupo de ataque del portaaviones USS Dwight D. Eisenhower está operando actualmente en el mar Rojo. Los aviones de combate F/A-18 de la Armada del portaaviones y los destructores del grupo han llevado a cabo múltiples ataques contra objetivos hutíes en Yemen, además de interceptar repetidamente lanzamientos de los hutíes contra buques comerciales y navales. En varias ocasiones, Estados Unidos también ha destruido drones marítimos.

Poco después del 7 de octubre, el secretario de Defensa, Lloyd Austin, ordenó al grupo de ataque del portaaviones USS Gerald R. Ford que se dirigiera al Mediterráneo oriental. Días después, el grupo de ataque del portaaviones USS Dwight D. Eisenhower se desplegó desde Estados Unidos y se dirigió a la región. El grupo anfibio USS Bataan, que ya se encontraba en el Golfo de Omán como parte de un intento de disuadir la agresión iraní, también fue enviado a aguas cercanas a Israel.

Eso puso a tres grandes grupos de buques de guerra, incluidos miles de marineros y una fuerza de respuesta preparada por los marines, en el Medio Oriente al mismo tiempo, una importante concentración de fuerzas estadounidenses en respuesta a la guerra en Gaza.

Pero en enero, cuando la guerra alcanzó la marca de los tres meses y no mostraba señales de un cese del fuego duradero, Estados Unidos comenzó a retirar algunas de sus fuerzas de la región. El grupo de ataque del portaaviones Ford, que se había ampliado varias veces, abandonó el mar Mediterráneo oriental a principios de enero, reemplazado por el grupo anfibio preparado de Bataan y la fuerza de respuesta rápida de los marines.

"Irán redujo sus reservas de uranio casi apto para armas, advierte el organismo de control nuclear","Rafael Grossi, director general de la Agencia Internacional de Energía Atómica (OIEA), habla en la sede de la agencia en Viena, Austria, el 11 de septiembre de 2023. (Alex Halada/AFP/Getty Images)

(CNN) -- Irán redujo sus reservas de uranio casi apto para armas en los meses transcurridos desde octubre de 2023, según un informe confidencial de la Agencia Internacional de Armas Atómicas (OIEA, por sus siglas en inglés) visto por CNN este martes.

En octubre, Irán poseía 128,3 kilogramos (282,9 libras) de uranio enriquecido aproximadamente al 60%, el nivel más alto documentado por la OIEA. En febrero, las reservas se habían reducido a 121,5 kilogramos, según el informe.

Irán redujo la cantidad de uranio casi apto para armas mezclando 31,8 kilogramos de las reservas con uranio enriquecido a un nivel mucho más bajo, alrededor del 2%, según el informe.

Sin embargo, si bien Irán había reducido sus reservas de uranio casi apto para armas, el informe también señaló un aumento constante en las reservas de uranio enriquecido al 20%. Estos crecieron de 567,1 kilogramos en octubre a 712,2 kilogramos en febrero.

Comúnmente se considera que el uranio apto para armas ha sido enriquecido por encima del 90%, mientras que cualquier valor superior al 20% se considera altamente enriquecido, según el Centro para el Control de Armas y la No Proliferación.

publicidad

El informe, elaborado por el director general de la OIEA, Rafael Grossi, cubre la implementación por parte de Irán de sus compromisos bajo el Plan de Acción Integral Conjunto (JCPOA, por sus siglas en inglés), un acuerdo de 2015 entre Irán y un grupo de potencias mundiales, destinado a limitar las actividades nucleares de Irán. Estados Unidos se retiró del acuerdo en 2018, durante la presidencia de Donald Trump.

Los expertos dicen que no hay indicios de que la reducción de las existencias tenga un impacto en el tiempo de ruptura, que es la cantidad de tiempo necesaria para producir suficiente material apto para armas nucleares. Irán ha sostenido que no busca construir armas nucleares.

Tanto Eric Brewer de la Nuclear Threat Initiative como Behnam Ben Taleblu de la Fundación para la Defensa de las Democracias dijeron a CNN que Irán podría fabricar múltiples bombas con su actual arsenal reportado, incluso después de la reducción.

""Es una pregunta abierta: por qué decidieron tomar estas medidas en este momento"", dijo Brewer. Tanto Brewer como Taleblu sugirieron que Irán podría haberlo hecho para evitar la censura en la reunión de la Junta de Gobernadores de la OIEA del próximo mes.

“En 2023, vimos a Irán reducir varias veces las tasas de enriquecimiento por razones políticas, ralentizándolas y luego incrementándolas mientras las reservas seguían creciendo”, dijo Taleblu. “Ahora, con las crecientes preocupaciones sobre las reservas y un lenguaje más fuerte de la OIEA sobre la transparencia, el régimen puede estar buscando evitar la censura en la junta directiva de la OIEA en marzo y, al mismo tiempo, evitar que se forme un consenso transatlántico en su contra en 2024”.

El Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. se negó a comentar sobre el informe de la OIEA porque aún no se había hecho público.

“Seguimos seriamente preocupados por la continua expansión de su programa nuclear por parte de Irán en formas que no tienen ningún propósito civil creíble, incluida su producción continua de uranio altamente enriquecido, y apreciamos los amplios esfuerzos de la OIEA para involucrar a Irán en cuestiones de larga data, relacionadas con obligaciones de salvaguardia de Irán”, dijo el lunes el portavoz Matthew Miller.

Mayores tensiones

La OIEA también señaló que en los últimos meses Irán había informado a la agencia nuclear de su decisión de retirar la designación de varios inspectores de la agencia.

La medida, aunque formalmente permitida, afectaría “directa y gravemente” la capacidad de la OIEA para realizar una verificación efectiva, según el informe.

“La verificación y el seguimiento de la agencia relacionados con el JCPOA se han visto gravemente afectados por el cese de la implementación por parte de Irán de sus compromisos relacionados con la energía nuclear en virtud del JCPOA. La situación se ha visto exacerbada por la decisión posterior de retirar todo el equipo de vigilancia y monitoreo relacionado con el JCPOA de la agencia”, dijo la OIEA.

La disminución reportada se produce en un momento de crecientes tensiones entre Irán y Estados Unidos por la guerra entre Israel y Hamas. Numerosos representantes respaldados por Irán en la región han lanzado ataques contra instalaciones militares estadounidenses desde que comenzó la guerra el 7 de octubre.

Las rutas marítimas internacionales en el mar Rojo también han sido objeto de ataques por parte de los rebeldes hutíes de Yemen, lo que provocó una campaña de bombardeos de la coalición encabezada por Estados Unidos contra los hutíes respaldados por Irán.

El Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. se negó a comentar sobre el informe de la OIEA porque aún no se había hecho público.

“Seguimos seriamente preocupados por la continua expansión de su programa nuclear por parte de Irán en formas que no tienen ningún propósito civil creíble, incluida su producción continua de uranio altamente enriquecido, y apreciamos los amplios esfuerzos de la OIEA para involucrar a Irán en cuestiones de larga data, relacionadas con obligaciones de salvaguardia de Irán”, dijo el lunes el portavoz Matthew Miller.

Mayores tensiones

La OIEA también señaló que en los últimos meses Irán había informado a la agencia nuclear de su decisión de retirar la designación de varios inspectores de la agencia.

La medida, aunque formalmente permitida, afectaría “directa y gravemente” la capacidad de la OIEA para realizar una verificación efectiva, según el informe.

“La verificación y el seguimiento de la agencia relacionados con el JCPOA se han visto gravemente afectados por el cese de la implementación por parte de Irán de sus compromisos relacionados con la energía nuclear en virtud del JCPOA. La situación se ha visto exacerbada por la decisión posterior de retirar todo el equipo de vigilancia y monitoreo relacionado con el JCPOA de la agencia”, dijo la OIEA.

La disminución reportada se produce en un momento de crecientes tensiones entre Irán y Estados Unidos por la guerra entre Israel y Hamas. Numerosos representantes respaldados por Irán en la región han lanzado ataques contra instalaciones militares estadounidenses desde que comenzó la guerra el 7 de octubre.

Las rutas marítimas internacionales en el mar Rojo también han sido objeto de ataques por parte de los rebeldes hutíes de Yemen, lo que provocó una campaña de bombardeos de la coalición encabezada por Estados Unidos contra los hutíes respaldados por Irán.

Israel y Hamas se distancian del optimismo de Biden sobre un acuerdo de cese del fuego en Gaza,"Biden dice que ahora es cuando espera un alto al fuego en Gaza 1:09

(CNN) -- Funcionarios de Israel, Hamas y Qatar fueron en contra del optimismo del presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, sobre que podría alcanzarse un acuerdo de cese del fuego a cambio de rehenes en Gaza a finales de esta semana, y sugirieron que persisten las diferencias a pesar de que los negociadores trabajan para garantizar un acuerdo.

Biden dijo este lunes durante una aparición pública en una heladería de Nueva York que esperaba que hubiera un alto el fuego en el conflicto entre Israel y Hamas para ""el próximo lunes"", mientras el número de muertos en Gaza se acerca a los 30.000, según el Ministerio de Salud del enclave.

Sin embargo, un funcionario de Israel dijo este martes a CNN que su país estaba ""sorprendido de que [Biden] utilizara la palabra lunes y de que utilizara la expresión alto el fuego"".

""No sé sobre qué base lo dijo"", dijo el funcionario israelí este martes, que pidió no ser nombrado debido a lo delicado del tema. El funcionario dijo que Israel estaba dispuesto a llegar a un acuerdo en los términos adecuados.

""Israel estará dispuesto a liberar prisioneros [palestinos] incluso hoy si se cumplen las condiciones"", dijo el funcionario.

Basem Naim, miembro del buró político de Hamas, declaró este martes a CNN que el grupo no tenía conocimiento de ningún acuerdo de alto el fuego que pudiera negociarse antes del próximo lunes. ""No hay nada"", afirmó Naim.

Qatar, que junto con Estados Unidos es un mediador clave en las negociaciones entre Israel y Hamas, añadió más cautela este martes e insinuó un plazo diferente al sugerido por Biden.

""Si hubiera un acuerdo, me verían más en una actitud animada"", dijo este martes Majed Al-Ansari, portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Qatar. ""Pero hasta ahora no tenemos un acuerdo y seguimos trabajando en las negociaciones en todos los frentes"".

""Hemos visto una trayectoria positiva por el mero hecho de que se están realizando las reuniones, pero aún tenemos que llegar a un acuerdo definitivo, en el que podamos anunciar, con suerte, antes del comienzo del Ramadán, una pausa humanitaria que alivie la tensión y nos permita hacer llegar más ayuda a Gaza y nos permita desescalar"".

Está previsto que el Ramadán comience la noche del 10 de marzo, una semana después de la fecha en la que Biden dijo que esperaba ver una resolución.

Ansari dijo que todavía hay desacuerdos sobre ""el número, la proporción y los movimientos de tropas"", sin dar más detalles. Es probable que se refiera al número de rehenes liberados a cambio de prisioneros palestinos y a la retirada de soldados israelíes de partes de Gaza.

Este lunes, CNN reportó que Hamas dio marcha atrás en algunas demandas clave en las negociaciones para un acuerdo en la entrega de rehenes y una pausa en los combates en Gaza tras la acusación del primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, sobre que la postura del grupo era ""delirante"", según dos fuentes con conocimiento de las conversaciones.

Reuters y Al Jazeera informaron este martes que Hamas estaba revisando un borrador de una propuesta para un alto el fuego inicial, de unas seis semanas de duración, durante el cual se intercambiarían 40 rehenes israelíes por 400 prisioneros palestinos.

El funcionario israelí confirmó este martes a CNN que se esperaba liberar a unos 40 rehenes en la fase inicial del acuerdo, y que Israel insiste en que se incluya a mujeres soldado en el grupo.

Equipos de Estados Unidos, Egipto, Israel y Qatar se reunieron el viernes en París y el lunes en Qatar.

Las personas implicadas en las conversaciones han manifestado con anterioridad que es probable que el acuerdo se aplique en varias fases y que, una vez alcanzado un acuerdo inicial, podría dar lugar —efectivamente— a una tregua de hasta seis semanas de duración con la liberación de un grupo de rehenes israelíes, entre ellos mujeres, niños, ancianos y enfermos, a cambio de un número menor de prisioneros palestinos al que Hamas había exigido inicialmente.

Durante la tregua se negociarían temas más delicados, como la liberación de los soldados israelíes varones que son rehenes, la prolongación de las condenas de los presos palestinos, la retirada de las fuerzas de las FDI y el fin permanente de la guerra, además de las cuestiones del ""día después"".

Al menos 1,7 millones de palestinos de Gaza han sido desplazados a la fuerza, según la ONU.
