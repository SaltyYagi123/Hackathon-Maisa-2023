Stocks will likely keep climbing over the next decade, because interest rates in the economy are priced just right, which means the ""roaring 1990s"" could make a comeback, according to Wall Street veteran Ed Yardeni.

The Yardeni Research president pointed to the stellar rally in stocks since October, with the S&P 500 close to notching yet another all-time-high this week. Meanwhile, the US economy could be poised to enter another decade of rapid growth, Yardeni said, which he previously dubbed as a return to the ""roaring '20s.""

Some Wall Street commentators have warned of a coming price correction, as high interest rates still risk pushing the economy into a recession.

But today's market is flashing a parallel to the late 90s, when interest rates in the economy were in a sweet spot and the stock market boomed, Yardeni said.

""[We] are considering the possibility that the second half of the 1990s' script might be the most likely scenario for the FFR over the rest of the current decade,"" Yardeni said in a note on Monday, referring to the federal funds rate. ""Back then, stock prices soared. The positive wealth effect boosted economic growth. Inflation was subdued by rapid productivity growth.""

Though interest rates were raised into the 4%-to-5% region in the late 90s to combat inflation, that was likely in line with the neutral interest rate, a theoretical interest rate level that neither expands nor contracts the economy. The result was a strong period of growth, with productivity peaking around 4% by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, unemployment and inflation slumped, with the jobless rate declining to around 4% while consumer prices fell to 2.7% in the late 90s.

Stocks also performed beautifully in the second half of the decade. The S&P 500 saw a monster 220% return from 1995 to the end of 1999, rising from a level of 459 to 1,469.

""That could very well describe the rest of the current decade,"" Yardeni said. ""If so, then perhaps the FFR will indeed stay higher.""

Central bankers have raised the federal funds rate to 5.25%-5.5% to tame inflation, the highest interest rates have been since 2001.

Though rates are elevated, the real federal funds rate, which adjusts for inflation, is actually hovering around 2.24%. Real rates ranged between 2%-4% through the second half of the 90s with ""no problem,"" Yardeni said, implying the US could pull off a soft landing.

Real rates are expected to keep a ""tight lid"" on inflation, Yardeni predicted, even while productivity and GDP climb higher. He expected the productivity rate to rise near 3.5% to 4.5% by the end of the 2020s, while real GDP remains around 3.1%, its historical average.

""If this is the 1990s all over again, are we in 1994 or are we closer to 1999? We aren't sure,"" he said. ""However, we are sure that, as occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs. That's another reason to believe that the economy will remain resilient and another reason why the Fed might hesitate to lower the FFR for a while — maybe a long while.""

Investors are still ambitiously pricing in rate cuts for 2024, though Fed officials have warned rates could stay higher for longer as they continue to monitor inflation. Markets are betting pricing in a 43% chance the Fed could cut interest rates 100 basis points or more by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool, more than the 75 basis points that the Fed has officially projected for the year.",https://i.insider.com/5b116c591ae6621b008b4749?width=1200&format=jpeg

CITIES ACROSS UKRAINE — Russia's military assault on Ukraine began a decade ago, when it occupied the southern peninsula of Crimea. A bloody invasion of eastern Ukraine, which involved active-duty Russian troops, the West says, followed.

Two years ago, that localized conflict gave way to a full-scale invasion by Russia's armed forces that has shaken every corner of Ukraine.

On this grim anniversary, NPR visited people in six Ukrainian cities who have adapted, each in their own way, to war — and maintained a sense of hope.

Odesa

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR

Artem Vasyuta offers tours of his legendary hometown even during war.

""My official title is tour guide, but I do this job because I want to tell Odesa's story,"" he says, pausing. ""A story that includes Ukrainians.""

Located on Ukraine's southern coast, Odesa is known as the Pearl of the Black Sea. Its port used to be a heady, multicultural crossroad where the dominant language was Russian. But Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine all but shut down the port and its exports. And two years later, Odesa has lost all sentimentality for anything related to Russia.

In December 2022, locals took down an enormous statue of Catherine the Great, the Russian empress credited (unfairly, many Ukrainians say) as the city's founder. Vasyuta points to the empty base where the statue once stood and says he's not sorry.

""Russians are trying to erase us as a country,"" he says. ""I don't see why we shouldn't erase their imperial monuments."" And, he adds, ""So much of Odesa is viewed through a Russian-Soviet lens. Our own place in our own city has been out of view.""

The tour guide has grown ambivalent about Odesa's reputation as a hedonistic city of crime — ""another Russian-Soviet myth,"" he says — immortalized by the fictional gangster Benya Krik in Soviet-Jewish writer Isaac Babel's Odessa Stories.

Europe In Ukraine's Odesa, a Soviet-era writer remains a powerful figure In Ukraine's Odesa, a Soviet-era writer remains a powerful figure Listen · 4:32 4:32

Vasyuta appreciates Babel, who was swept up by the Stalinist purges and executed during World War II, and often takes visitors to the writer's childhood neighborhood of Moldavanka, which in the early 20th century was a center of Odesa's vibrant Jewish community. But he also includes stops by monuments and plaques dedicated to Ukrainian politicians, poets and scientists.

""This war has made me want to show every single one of them,"" he says. ""The more the Russians bomb us, the more Ukrainian they make this city.""

After repeated Russian attacks last summer damaged dozens of cultural sites in Odesa, UNESCO added Odesa's historic center to its World Heritage List. Meanwhile, the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet, which had its headquarters in Sevastopol on the occupied Crimean Peninsula, has largely fled after Ukrainian attacks. Odesa's port is exporting again.

Dnipro

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR

For more than 30 years, Dr. Iryna Kulbach has delivered babies — ""at least 15,000,"" she says — at a large maternity hospital in this elegant central Ukrainian city.

""Even during war, there is joy in a maternity ward,"" the doctor says. ""We call it 'the place of happiness,' because isn't happiness the smell of a newborn baby?""

Ecstatic new fathers often spray-paint messages of love on the walls outside. ""Thank you darling for our little Andriy,"" says one written in baby blue.

Dnipro, which sits on a river of the same name in central Ukraine, is about 100 miles from any combat zone, but it's become a frequent target of Russian attacks. Still, Kulbach believed — perhaps naively she now says — that her hospital would be spared, even though Russian forces had hit so many others around Ukraine.

That all changed on Dec. 29, 2023. Kulbach arrived at the hospital as an air raid siren blared. The hospital's staff and patients, including four newborns, went into a basement shelter. Then, as Kulbach was going into the shelter herself, a missile hit.

The building shook. She smelled smoke. The hospital was on fire. Other doctors were arriving at the hospital, including Tetyana Andreieva.

""We were supposed to spend a few minutes exchanging New Year's presents,"" Andreieva says. ""But everything was on fire. Broken glass from windows was falling from the sky.""

But everyone inside the bomb shelter was alive. When Kulbach emerged, she saw the scale of the destruction. The maternity hospital would have to be entirely rebuilt.

On a recent afternoon, she stands outside its ruins, which are cordoned off by a barbed wire fence. On the other side, a young woman waves.

""When are you opening again?"" the woman asks. ""I want to have my second child here, with you, at this place of happiness!""

The doctor smiles but says later that she's not sure when the hospital will reopen. Ukraine doesn't have the money to rebuild it, she says, and aid from Ukraine's allies looks shakier than ever. Kulbach wants to find hope.

""Look,"" she says, pointing to clawed-up earth covered with rubble. ""That's where a missile hit, and yet 50 meters away, I see children dancing in a playground.""

Kharkiv

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR

Ukraine's second-largest city, just 20 miles from the country's northeastern border with Russia, has been under bombardment almost continuously since the full-scale invasion began two years ago.

In the historic city center, the heart of Ukraine's intellectual community, the windows of its modernist buildings are boarded up, though that doesn't mean the businesses inside are closed. A patisserie that sells the city's signature cake, a chocolate-and-wafer delight called Kharkivskyi, has only closed for three weeks in the last two years of war.

""It is very important to feel like the city is alive,"" says architect Max Rozenfeld. ""Because, despite everything that's happened to it, underneath the ruins and the pain, it is.""

Rozenfeld is among a group of architects who hope to rebuild Kharkiv after the war, with the help of famed British urban architect Norman Foster, the subject of Rozenfeld's Ph.D. dissertation. The plan envisions Kharkiv as a city for creatives and scientists.

It involves reconstructing bombed-out administrative buildings into artistic gems and creating a vast science hub in Saltivka, a neighborhood that invading Russian troops almost razed.

""Some people are annoyed by this kind of talk,"" Rozenfeld says. ""They say it's very irresponsible to sit in a shelled city and dream about the future.""

He understands. Each attack on Kharkiv feels like a body blow to the soul. Rozenfeld brings up a family of five — the youngest was a 10-month-old baby — burned alive on Feb. 12. Their building caught fire after a drone attack by Russians on a nearby oil depot. Rozenfeld had to give a talk the next day.

Loading...

""At first, I didn't think I could do it,"" he says, ""because the tragedy was just so terrible. And then I thought, the more terrible the state of affairs, the more important it is to dream — to not lose hope.""

This war won't end anytime soon, he says, and its third year is already bringing a feeling of dread, he adds. Russian troops are advancing in the Kharkiv region. Rozenfeld also fears another Donald Trump presidency, which he says would isolate Ukraine and help the Kremlin.

""Kharkiv is a frontier city, and it's always been able to adapt on its own terms,"" he says. ""Even after everything we have been through, it also has a place for its dreamers.""

Kyiv

Enlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR

Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, always felt invincible to Liudmyla Lysenko.

She grew up here, spending weekends exploring the city's large, lush parks or the tree-filled islands on the Dnipro River. It was the center of power and politics.

Yet just days after Russia's full-scale invasion, Russian tanks and armored vehicles sat just outside the city's outskirts. Lysenko's parents called from the suburbs.

""They watched these terrible convoys passing by, counting something like 250 tanks,"" she says. Those Russian troops would occupy towns outside Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka, and torture and execute residents, according to witnesses.

Lysenko would never feel safe in her hometown again, even as normalcy — busy restaurants and bars, playgrounds filled with laughing children — returned. Beneath the normalcy, she says, there is a collective anxiety that the Russians will come back.

Loading...

""They are our enemies because they want to kill us,"" she says. ""We realize that if we don't defend ourselves, they will kill us all.""

Lysenko continued working, but her anxiety exhausted her. Sometimes, when she came home, she collapsed on her bed, unable to rise even for an air raid alert. She avoided TV news, which spun a government-approved narrative that is suspiciously upbeat.

""And then one day, for some reason, I turned the TV on,"" she says, ""and I saw this commercial for a course training civilians to defend themselves in case of another invasion.""

She signed up right away. She dressed up in her warmest waterproof clothes and drove to a secret location in the woods of the Kyiv region, joining a group that included mostly teenagers in their first year of university.

An instructor handed out paintball guns and first aid kits and began battlefield simulations. How to fight inside a building. How to defend yourself in the forest. How to help the wounded.

""You can't hide from fear,"" Lysenko says. ""You have to face it, and then you won't feel it.""

Sumy

Ukrainian POWs freed in prisoner exchanges usually cross through a checkpoint in this northeastern Ukrainian region, named for its principal city, Sumy. When that happens, Nataliya Kucherenko gets a notification on her phone from the social media app Telegram; she subscribes to a channel that monitors the border for convoys.

Then she gently picks up a giant Ukrainian flag printed with a photo of her 25-year-old son, Vova, and heads to a main road in her hometown, Krasnopillya, barely 15 miles from the Russian border. She unfurls the flag and waits, sometimes for hours, for the convoy to pass.

""It doesn't matter whether it's raining or snow, or whether it's hot, I wait,"" she says, holding back tears. ""I keep hoping he will be on that bus.""

Vova has been a prisoner of war in Russia for nearly two years. He defended Mariupol, the southeastern port city on the sea of Azov that Russian troops destroyed and now occupy. She doesn't know where or how he is.

A year ago, Kucherenko found an unverified video and post online suggesting he had been sentenced to life in prison in Russia.

""That destroyed me,"" she says. She says she can't eat or sleep and has lost so much weight that her neighbors say that it's like she's been in Russian captivity herself. Her husband is on the front line, so she's home alone. She has kept Vova's room just as he left it.

Kramatorsk

Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region has been fighting Russia for a decade, since Russia-backed separatists declared independence in 2014. The lively city of Kramatorsk, which remains under Ukrainian control, has learned to live with the ever-present threat of Russian attack.

Its heart-and-soul center was a restaurant, Ria Pizzeria, where locals gathered for weddings, birthdays, christenings and reunions.

""This was our family,"" especially after Russia's full-scale invasion brought the war even closer, says Iryna Savchenko, one of the co-owners. ""It was a home not only for our staff, but also for our family.""

Ria Pizzeria became a popular spot not only for locals but for journalists and aid workers drawn by the war. Savchenko says it was a place where you could always hear laughter and music, no matter how grim the news outside was.

""We didn't think at the beginning of the full-scale war that we would be targets,"" she says. ""But we soon found out that everyone in this country can be a target.""

On June 29 of last year, a Russian Iskander missile hit Ria Pizzeria. Savchenko had just traveled to Kyiv when she got the call.

Loading...

""They told me everything was gone,"" she says. She spent all night driving back, arriving at 5 a.m.

""When we arrived, there was a lot of rubble, a lot of destruction,"" Savchenko says. ""I thought everyone inside was dead.""

The attack killed 13 people, including pizzeria staff, local teenagers and a talented novelist and poet, Viktoria Amelina. Their photos are in a small, flower-filled shrine outside the pizzeria's ruins. Dozens more were wounded.

Savchenko says the grief broke her. But she didn't want the Russian attack to kill Kramatorsk's spirit, too.

""We decided it would be good for everyone in town if we opened another place,"" she says. Ria Pizzeria's surviving team wanted to contribute to Kramatorsk's economy, while also honoring those who died.

Six months after Ria Pizzeria's destruction, Savchenko and her partners opened a restaurant in Kramatorsk that's built partly underground. It's called Friends.

""We came up with the name right away, without any discussion,"" she says. ""Because it's a place for our friends, those we know now, those who we will meet and, especially, those who are no longer with us.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/02/21/6-cities-ukraine_wide-a37ab604c1cc3d3a54742daf37fa9e038febe81c-s1400-c100.jpg

ASEBU, Ghana — Nestled in the sleepy town of Asebu, a few miles inland from the Atlantic along Ghana's Cape Coast, lies a serene 5,000 acre rural settlement. A mud road at the entrance weaves through a dense, green landscape of dozens of homes and partially built concrete structures, enveloped by miles of farmland and palm trees.

""Nobody's ever lived here before,"" says 74-year-old Lenval Skiers, from the sun-lit lounge of his six-bedroom home and guesthouse. ""It was me alone in the forest. It was idle land, but I braved it."" From his wide-set balcony on the second floor, Skiers points to his large garden, full of clusters of cassava, avocado and sugar cane. Beyond lies Pan-African Village, a stretch of land recast as an idyllic haven for settlers from the African diaspora.

Skiers is among a small but growing community of some 30 people, most who've arrived from the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. They regard themselves as the first wave of settlers, among a new African community in Asebu, carving a new life in their ancestral homeland, devoid of racism and repression in the countries their ancestors were forcibly taken to.

They're among the latest in a rich history, where many thousands of foreigners of African heritage have made Ghana their home — a proud legacy championed by independence leader Kwame Nkrumah, and his vision of Ghana as a beacon of African unity. Many are drawn to Ghana as a country cast abroad as a prosperous African nation on the rise. But a wave of returning diaspora, while welcomed, has become more contentious during some of the most trying economic times in decades.

And in Pan-African Village, brewing tensions over ownership and privileged access to the land threaten to unravel its promise. ""I was the first to arrive here,"" Skiers says, beaming. ""And many more are coming behind me."" He was born in Jamaica but spent most of his life in Canada. He lived there for almost forty years, mainly working in a shipping factory, but it was never his home. ""Canada is a country built by white people. And we as blacks and native people are regarded as second-class citizens."" When he retired, he was set on leaving and envisioned a life elsewhere.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jude Lartey for NPR Jude Lartey for NPR

Then in 2020, the traditional ruler of Asebu Town, the ""paramount chief"" of the area offered a golden opportunity. He announced he would set aside 5,000 acres of farmland in his town and offer free plots to anyone in the African heritage diaspora planning to settle there.

On social media, particularly youtube, prominent influencers promoted the settlement as a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire valuable land in Ghana, a country marketed as a prosperous African nation on the rise. Skiers became immersed in several such videos, and reached out to one influencer, Ekow Simpson, who encouraged him to make the journey. ""I thought that was a lot of land and I should be able to get a piece of it,"" Skiers says.

The settlement was gifted as part of Ghana's 2019 Year of Return, a year-long government campaign calling on people of African heritage to ""return"" to Ghana. It was cast as a historical turning point, coming 400 years after the first ships took enslaved Africans from ports in West Africa across the Atlantic, to Virginia in the United States. Since then, thousands have arrived, settling in Ghana, and more than 560 people have acquired the land, paying administration fees of $1,000-$1,200 per plot to the paramount chief.

""We've reached a stage now where there is an option to leave these countries,"" Skiers says, ""to find land in countries where you can be totally free. Free from racism, free from unemployment and low wages.""

But the settlement has led to bitterness within the local community, despite the rising construction and economic activity the settlement has spurred in Asebu — a breezy, gently buzzing town of largely lower-income farmers, construction workers and businesses reliant on tourism. It has ignited bitter opposition threatening to tip into violence and raised questions on whether Pan-African Village, parts which belonged to a number of local families, should ever have been given away.

""Hunting us from the land""

""We've been farming there for generations,"" says 59-year-old farmer Kwesi Otu-Bensil. ""Now it has been destroyed."" Otu-Bensil and a group of farmers and members of his extended family, the Akoa Anona's, sit outside his modest bungalow in Asebu, surrounded by small vegetable patches and cockerels.

Otu-Bensil used to farm yams, coconuts, oranges and several other crops, on 123 acres of his family's farmland, which is now a part of Pan-African Village. But in 2020, the paramount chief seized it and the fields were leveled. The destruction and dispossession of their farmland has had hit the livelihoods of Otu-Bensil and over 150 farmers that relied on it. ""If I earned 100 cedis before [$8.33], for example, now I earn 30,"" he says, describing how he struggles to support his family of five children.

Abusuapanin Kojo Badu, 68, is Otu-Bensil's cousin and the most senior figure in the family. He unfurls a map of the land onto the ground, and a copy of the registration proving his family's ownership of the land, documented in Ghana's land registry. He first heard about the paramount chief's plans for a diaspora settlement in Asebu during the Year of Return. ""I said, 'fine, it's a good idea. But the land is owned by my family.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jude Lartey for NPR Jude Lartey for NPR

The paramount chief refused to pay him for it, Badu says, arguing the chief would not be earning any profit as it would be given for free. ""We met so many times about this very land and I said, no, you can never tell me it's for free""

Eventually the talks collapsed. The paramount chief declared he had the legal right over the land and seized it. None of the 150 farmers were compensated, Kojo Badu says. Five of Kojo Badu's relatives, including two of his siblings, died over the last two years from illnesses that he claimed were exacerbated when they lost their livelihoods.

The family has taken the paramount chief to court, along with other land agents involved in Pan-African Village. A high court injunction from October 2023 seen by NPR, suspended all construction on the disputed 123 acres of land claimed by the Akoa Anona family. But construction hasn't stopped and the injunction was never enforced by authorities.

Daniel Kweku, a 44-year-old farmer in the family, says when they discovered that new residents in the village were still building on their land, despite the court order, they were incensed. They confronted workers on the construction site, showed them the injunction and ordered them to stop building. When the police arrived, it was Kweku and two other family members that were arrested. Three days later they were released without charges. Since their release, the tensions have only deepened.

When Kweku tried to go back to his family's land, threats of violence made him turn away. ""Some of the diasporas told us they have guns,"" he says, "" so if we go there again, they will shoot us.""

NPR was unable to verify all the claims but the Akoa Anona family, and two other residents in Asebu town said that gun ownership has become increasingly common in Pan African Village. One resident of the village, who settled there from Chicago, also told NPR that he had purchased a gun, to protect himself.

Kweku said the family were threatened by one resident of the village who hired a security guard armed with a pump-action rifle, stationed outside the compound of his new home — built on Kweku's family's land — and told him to shoot anyone trespassing on the property. ""So we have our land and then the diasporas get (the) power to buy a gun, and are hunting us from the land.""

The seemingly growing presence of arms, in a largely peaceful town where arms are not prevalent, has fuelled outrage in the Akoa Anona family, and among residents of the town resentful of the settlement. And the legal dispute over the land has also led to mounting frustration, as such cases can often take several years to resolve.""

""It was a virgin land, no one occupied it.""

The modest palace of Asebu's paramount chief is perched on a hill overlooking the town. ""I wanted to show our diaspora brothers and sisters that we care for them,"" says Amanfi VII, the traditional ruler of Asebu, from his office. ""They are from Africa and in Africa everybody is entitled to a piece of land.""

For years, international visitors, many from the United States, have been drawn to the former slave ports dotted along Cape Coast, memorializing the horrors of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The challenge, he says, has been how to encourage them to stay. ""If we don't tie them down with anything concrete, they will visit the castles, weep a little, and then the next moment they are on the plane back to the U.S."" Pan-African Village was his solution, endorsed by Ghana's president, Nana Akufo Addo.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jude Lartey for NPR Jude Lartey for NPR

The paramount chief insists he has the legal right over the land, which he describes as ""stool land"", meaning land under his control. He also insists that no one was displaced from it. ""It was a virgin land, no one occupied it."" And that only a few people farmed on the land, and were compensated.

Pan African Village is one of a rising number of diaspora settlements in Ghana, many which have emerged since the Year of Return. Another, formerly called Wakanda One City, named after the fictional kingdom in the Marvel comic book and movie Black Panther,is also planned in Cape Coast.

Others founded decades ago provide a more cautionary tale. Fihankra is one of them. The 200-acre development was settled in Ghana's eastern region by a group of African Americans in the mid-90's. Like Pan African Village, it was envisioned as a haven for returning diasporas. But the dream ended in bloodshed. A dispute between locals and the diaspora over ownership of the land, resulted in the murder of two African-American women in 2015. A local man was later convicted and sentenced to death.

Her two-story lime-green and orange home, with guest quarters rented to visitors, sits like a colorful dollhouse within the village. While the land dispute by farmers in Asebu continues, her dream of a new life in Pan-African Village goes on untouched.

At the far end of her white living room, she sits on a wooden throne, her feet on a stool, resting on a lion-print rug. Traditional Ghanaian kente fabric is draped over her shoulder. She is now known by her Ghanaian name, Na Bwafwoyena Oyem Mpese Tulu I, and a new title. ""My title is Diaspora Development Queen for all of Ghana,"" she says.

Tulu says she was crowned by chiefs from the Ga ethnic group (prevalent in another region of the country) last year, to coordinate the diaspora in Ghana to develop the country. Like Skiers and the other new residents of the village, Mpese Tulus is evangelical about the importance of the diaspora spurring economic prosperity in the town.

""We want to lift people out of poverty, in Asebu and all of Ghana,"" Tulu says and has proposed investment plans to the paramount chief, currently under consideration. In her plan, the African diaspora to build pay-to-use toilets across the town, to tackle open defecation, and would receive a return on their investment from the fees.

She was born in Jamaica then lived most of her life in the U.S. But her future there began to feel bleak. ""I retired and the money that I was gonna get for my social security could not pay a light bill or water rate."" Then in 2021, a friend of hers in Atlanta, who'd bought land in Ghana, told her he would finally be traveling there to see it. ""He said, 'why don't you come?'"" she recalls.

Soon after she arrived, she acquired land in Pan-African Village.. ""It was a salvation for me,"" she says. ""I didn't have to pay a mortgage."" According to another resident in the village, most of the homes cost $40,000 to $50,000 to build, a small fraction of the cost in the U.S. But while her life has flourished in the village, with new land and status, her disconnect with the community she now lords over grows clear. In explaining how local people live, she repeats a racial, African trope, describing their poverty in glowing terms.

""In Ghana, people are humble. They don't need much to live. Food is the most important to a lot of people. They don't even need a fork, they use their hands. They have no problems sleeping flat on the ground,"" she says. ""I mean, it sounds like poverty, but when you think about it, how much do we really need to survive?""

She says that resentment from some local people around Pan-African Village was partly understandable. ""They should have access to land but it's not our fault. We worked for our money and bought the land. Nothing was given to us for free.""

""We're afraid of what will happen.""

Since the Year of Return, a new wave of visitors has largely been welcomed. More than 100,000 people visited the country in 2019 compared to the previous year, adding almost $2 billion to Ghana's economy, according to the government. Thousands have arrived and moved to Ghana since then, many drawn to a country marketed as a prosperous West African democracy on the rise.

But the country's growing attraction as a touch-point to the engagement with the continent, has become more controversial, as contrasting visions of Ghana have come to collide. While its international appeal as a haven has flourished, for many in Ghana, the country is in rapid decline. A cost of living crisis has exacerbated poverty, with near-record inflation of over 35% for much of last year. Ghana's currency has experienced a sharp decline and the country has agreed a $3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, after defaulting on most of its foreign debt.

Settlements and land transactions have long been a point of tension. While some who've settled in Pan-African Village have taken arms amid disputes, others have handled it differently. Seventy-five-year-old Nana Kofi — as he became re-named in Ghana — first arrived in Ghana from St. Louis in 1997, he explains from the serene compound of a medical clinic he built within his community, offering subsidized health care.

In 2010, he moved to Elmina, along Cape Coast and bought plots of land from a local family. After the purchase, a group within the family argued they were not paid and were displaced from their land without compensation.

""It was a mess!"" Kofi says, adding African diasporas who'd settled there were often caught in the middle of land disputes. ""But I decided to pay them, because the amount they were asking for meant a lot to them, but to me a few hundred dollars for land doesn't hurt as much.""

In Asebu, some are increasingly worried about how the rising tensions will end. Ato Wright, 44, owns a small farm there and also works as an agent. He is part of a growing class of middle men, helping foreigners buy land along Cape Coast.

""You cannot come to me and say, 'I want you to move from this land because I want to give it free of charge to your brother in the diaspora.' It will create animosity,"" Wright says. ""Encouraging our African brothers to come to Asebu wasn't a bad idea at all. But let the locals also feel the same sense of belonging. Let us feel that we've also benefited.""

Farmer Kwesi Otu Bensil, aggrieved at the loss of his ancestral land, describes the African diasporas in Pan-African Village in conflicting and revealing ways. At times they are his ""brothers and sisters,"" then other times ""the whites"" who have occupied his land without his consent.

""They've built their houses, their bungalows. They've fenced it,"" Bensil says. ""And now we can't go there. If we do, we're afraid of what will happen.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/01/20/img_0458-copy_wide-615d09ff495ff1beafaf0a8f07277d43eff4fb9b-s1400-c100.jpg

Kaja Braziel has historically voted Democrat. The 30-year-old Detroit native remembers casting her first-ever vote for Barack Obama, which eventually factored into her support for President Joe Biden.

Four years later, Braziel says she's apprehensive about voting for Biden again. The Wayne State University senior, who also works full time, is upset that Biden hasn't done more to address student loans. She acknowledges he's not solely responsible for falling short of his promises, but says it's an issue nonetheless.

""It doesn't stop that from affecting my thought process of, when do I get to be a real adult?"" said Braziel, who sacrificed an additional job in order to commit to her studies. ""When do I get to buy a house? When do I get to feel stable enough to think about seriously having kids?""

Braziel has her doubts about continuing to support Biden, but says she doesn't feel drawn to Republican candidates either. Eight months out from the general election, she told NPR's Morning Edition she doesn't know who to vote for, or whether she will even vote at all.

""It doesn't seem like any choice is really a good choice at all,"" said Braziel. ""It feels more so like you're caught between the devil you know and the devil you don't. And at this point in time, it feels like both the devils that we know. And I'm not comfortable with either of them.""

Braziel is not alone.

NPR's Morning Edition spoke with many metro Detroit residents ahead of Tuesday's primary who didn't plan to vote because they assumed Donald Trump and Biden's victories were a foregone conclusion — an assumption that proved correct within minutes of polls closing.

People of all ages and backgrounds — from college students to autoworkers — said they weren't sure who, if anyone, to vote for in November either.

While their preferred parties, voting histories and policy concerns varied, many cited the economy, immigration, foreign military aid and societal divisions as their top issues, and said neither Trump nor Biden have done enough to solve them.

There was palpable disillusionment across the board, consistent with national polling that shows a majority of U.S. adults are pessimistic about the likely nominees and the state of politics in general.

That could spell trouble for both parties, since Michigan is one of a handful of swing states expected to help decide the presidency. Trump won it by just under 11,000 votes in 2016, while Biden won by over 154,000 votes in 2020, a year that saw record turnout of 5.5 million voters.

Conversations with eligible voters in the Detroit area help explain why enthusiasm is dimming — especially among key demographic groups like young voters and Black voters — and what the leading candidates would need to do to win them back.

A family of autoworkers worries about immigration, inflation and division

For Shelly and Matt Zissler, 47 and 50, working on cars is in their blood. The third- and second-generation autoworkers met on the job and got married in 2019. The following year, they both voted for Trump.

That was the first time Shelly, a lifelong Democrat, voted Republican. She says it's because she felt Trump was ""mentally better to run our country."" Matt, who identifies as a libertarian, had voted for Trump before but describes 2020 as a ""very painful vote.""

Sitting at home in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, the couple tells Morning Edition's Leila Fadel that they're not sure how they'll vote come November, but they wish they had different choices.

""I personally would like to see new people running,"" Shelly said. ""Because I feel like we're just going to keep repeating this cycle of what we've already been through, if it's the same two people.""

They could look to leadership of the United Auto Workers union — of which they are among more than 380,000 members in several states — for guidance on how to vote. UAW president Shawn Fain officially endorsed Biden last month, a coveted distinction in a state where support from blue-collar workers buoyed Trump in 2016.

It's a major get for the candidate who bills himself as the most pro-worker president in U.S. history, and became the first sitting president to join a picket line in modern history when he showed his support for striking autoworkers last fall. But it doesn't necessarily translate into votes from all UAW members.

""I will never let anyone tell me who to vote for,"" said Matt. ""I'll take information from everyone. But in the end I'll make up my own mind, whether it's a union-endorsed candidate or not.""

The two say their top concerns include immigration and foreign aid. Shelly blames Biden for the record number of migrants crossing the southern border, and says she doesn't understand ""why it can't be figured out."" Matt wants the government to stop sending money to wars overseas and do more to help people struggling at home.

""I still want to help people whenever we can,"" he said. ""But what if it comes at the cost of our own people, especially our veterans?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Cromie for NPR Elaine Cromie for NPR

Both are also concerned about the prices of things like gas and groceries. Shelly's 28-year-old son, Matt Vaughan — a fourth-generation autoworker — says he still struggles at times, despite the generous pay raise he got in the most recent union contract.

Above all, the Zisslers take issue with how divided the country is. They say they have lost friends over politics. And they blame politicians in D.C., who they see as arguing with each other instead of listening to their constituents.

""I think we're mirroring Washington more and more and more,"" Matt said. ""They're supposed to be leading us and they're acting like fools over there.""

They hope the candidates will do more to try to bring people together. They believe the right person could do it — but don't think that's either of the names poised to be on the ballot this fall.

Some Black churchgoers have lost faith in Biden

Black voters are credited with helping Biden win Michigan in 2020, thanks in large part to churches and other organizations who mobilized their members. That's particularly true of Detroit, where Biden beat Trump by 94% to 5%.

And yet some Black voters in the city, especially younger Black voters, told NPR that they've lost faith in Biden. As they filed out of Sunday services at Greater New Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, several shared that they had yet to decide who to vote for in the general election.

Ka'Marr Coleman-Byrd, a 27-year-old tax consultant who voted for Biden in 2020, says he'll make up his mind closer to November based on where things stand with issues like foreign aid, race relations and student loans.

""Growing up, I feel like I voted Democrat just because it just seemed like the thing to do,"" he said. ""I'd say now ... I'm sort of more into politics and seeing exactly what both parties present, so it's not just like a blind vote in a sense.""

Just 50% of Black adults nationally approve of Biden, down from 86% in July 2021, according to a December AP-NORC poll. And there are signs that Black Michiganders' support for Biden — which Democratic strategists see as key to his reelection — is waning.

A Howard University Initiative on Public Opinion poll released this month found that 91% of Black voters in Michigan plan to vote in the general election. When asked who they would vote for if that were today, 49% of respondents said Biden and 26% said Trump.

Deasia Sampson, 28, said she always makes it her duty to vote, even though she's not sure who it will be for this time around. She points to student loan forgiveness, inflation and funding for schools as her top concerns, especially as a mom of a 3-year-old.

Sampson works for the state Department of Health and Human Services, helping administer EBT and Medicaid programs. And she said she's seen firsthand how many people are applying for benefits compared to before the COVID pandemic.

""Yeah they have this or have that, but they're still struggling with food, still struggling with their utility bills, still struggling with medical coverage,"" she added.

Her husband, CJ Sampson, agrees. While he considers himself a liberal, he's lost confidence in Biden. The 31-year-old wishes he had seen more police reform since voting for Biden in 2020, is torn about whether his life was better under Trump or Biden.

""It's kind of a mixture of both,"" he said.

Several churchgoers in their 70s also gave Biden mixed reviews, docking points for things like high health care costs and the amount of money the U.S. is giving to Ukraine. Biden's age — arguably his biggest political vulnerability — was a deterrent for some and a nonissue for others.

Velma Matthews, 76, voted for Biden in 2020 and plans to do so again. She thinks he's a good person and believes in his politics. But she's not necessarily pleased with how the government is functioning.

Her advice for politicians? ""Get down to doing the business of government and stop all this craziness that's going on.""

Dissatisfied college students wonder how to make their votes count

Wayne State University's Detroit campus was mostly quiet last Friday at lunchtime, but not at the long, narrow table where six undergraduates gathered to share their election anxieties with Morning Edition.

The students range in age from 19 to 30 and hail from various parts of Michigan. Many of them are majoring in global studies. And all of them — not just Braziel — are unhappy with the choice likely awaiting them in November.

""In the last election, I remember feeling disappointed that I couldn't vote, because it felt more meaningful then — it felt like a reaction against Trump,"" said Addison Tracy, 21. ""Rolling around to this election and being able to vote in it, with probably the same two candidates and two choices ... I don't feel hopeful or like I'm voting for something that will be that meaningful.""

Michigan saw a surge in young voters in 2020, to Biden's advantage. And voters 18-29 turned out at a rate of 37% in Michigan in 2022, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University — far higher than any other state it analyzed and the national average youth turnout rate itself.

But many students told NPR they're not sure whether they'll vote this year — at all, let alone for Biden. Their top concerns include the economy, human rights, the Israel-Hamas war and the state of politics in general.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Rachel Treisman/NPR Rachel Treisman/NPR

Rania Umer, 19, does not think she'll vote. She doesn't support Trump, citing Jan. 6 and his human rights track record. But she also disagrees with Biden's response to the war — specifically, the fact that the U.S. has not called for a permanent cease-fire or stopped sending military aid to Israel.

""If someone does not want either of these things, what are they supposed to do?"" she asked. ""It's not like we have a choice. We are being pushed to vote undecided, third party, not vote at all.""

That sense of disappointment fueled a movement of Arab American, Muslim and other young voters, mostly in the Detroit metro area, to vote ""uncommitted"" on Tuesday as a warning to Biden: Change course on Gaza or risk losing our votes in November. The campaign had achieved more than 10 times its goal of 10,000 votes by early Wednesday morning.

Some students around the table said they'll ultimately vote for Biden in November, despite their reservations. Several specifically described it as a form of ""harm reduction,"" comparing Biden's stance on abortion access and LGBTQ rights to that of Trump.

""There aren't good options for any of us,"" said Tracy. ""We're going to have to find other ways, whether it's direct action or organizing and protesting ... to show what we want, because voting clearly doesn't seem to be a tool that's working right now.""

Collectively, the students said they feel taken for granted by Democrats, turned off by Republicans and dismayed that each party seems to be campaigning on what to vote against, rather than for.

Jovan Martin, a junior, said there's a clear need for a change in American politics, and that could start with people taking a stand in this election. He himself is torn between voting undecided or for Biden.

""Why is it that I have to vote in an election for two people that I hate, for two people that I feel like don't represent me, for two people that are the oldest in American history?"" Martin said. ""And then it's like, oh, maybe our democracy, maybe there's a problem here. And then if we get enough people, it spreads like a virus. And then, that's change.""

What then, do they say, to people who say they're risking democracy — by throwing away their votes or potentially helping pave the way for another Trump term? Some acknowledged it's not a decision they make lightly or even proudly. Others were quick to dismiss the idea that this is an especially consequential election.

""Are we not going to forget the decades' worth of election that had the slavery debate, that actually rended our country and had a civil war?"" said Sandeep Menon, 23, who is also a member of the Michigan Army National Guard.

""The issue that we have to worry about is not that, oh, our democracy is just going to suddenly end if Trump were to become president ... Our institutions get eroded away when we fail to maintain them.""

Over an hour into the conversation, with a certain heaviness in the air, NPR asked the students whether there was anything giving them hope. The prevailing answer was the discussion itself.

""I know for a fact there are thousands upon thousands of people that agree with every single one of us,"" Martin said. ""And if we're able to talk and convey these things, this is democracy, what we're doing right here.""

The US is likely to avoid slipping into a recession, according to Wells Fargo head macro strategist Michael Schumacher.

""The big question is: what's the chance of a really nasty landing? So maybe growth tips a little below zero, does it go deeply negative?"" he said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday. ""We at Wells Fargo think that chance is vanishingly low at this point.""

If any, the factor most likely to spoil that view and knock the economy off its feet right now is the labor market, Schumacher said.

But the job market has shown signs of strength lately, with new job additions in January coming in well above estimates, and unemployment staying near historically low levels. However, Schumacher said a sudden shift could threaten the US's chances of dodging a downturn.

""Labor markets are fickle and they can go from robust to really weak to unpleasant in the span of three to six months,"" he said.

The more people who take GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, the faster the US economy could grow, a Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note on Thursday.

The US GDP could grow by an extra 1% if 60 million Americans took GLP-1 drugs by 2028, Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote.

Hatzius said health-related problems keep people from participating in the labor force and inhibit economic growth. Obesity increases the risk of serious health problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.

The US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, said that China is torn between seeking foreign investment and its desire to control data about its businesses and citizens.

Speaking to Lesley Stahl on Sunday's edition of 60 Minutes, Burns said that China had launched a crackdown on US companies in China, raiding their offices and, in one case, arresting Chinese employees.

""It accused Western consulting firms of espionage and stealing national security and military secrets,"" Burns said of China.

He added that China had passed an amendment to national security laws, meaning that employees of American firms conducting due diligence checks for potential investors could be accused of spying.

""You know, I think they want to control data about the Chinese people, about Chinese companies. And so, that I think is at the heart of the problem with those American companies operating in that sphere,"" said Burns.

Last year, Chinese authorities raided several consulting firms, including US companies Mintz and Bain & Co. Chinese authorities arrested five Mintz employees in a raid on the company's Beijing offices in March 2023.

The raids came amid worsening relations between the US and China, with the US shooting down what it claimed was a Chinese spy balloon off the US coast in February 2023.

But with China's economy slowing down and foreign investment drying up, President, Xi Jinping has sought to improve relations with the US, meeting with President Joe Biden at the APEC summit in San Francisco last December, and addressing US business leaders.

In recent decades, China has experienced explosive economic growth. But Xi has also intensified China's repression of domestic dissent, launching a wide-ranging domestic surveillance program.

Burns said that China was pursuing contradictory policies that were scaring away investors.

""I think there's been a contradiction in the messaging from the government here in China to the rest of the world. On the one hand, they say, 'We're open for business. We want American, Chi-- Japanese businesses here.'

A hard-landing recession is certain to come for the economy, and high rates are to blame even as markets start positioning for the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy this year, says Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief US economist.

Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Zentner responded to Jamie Dimon's recent comments on the economy, in which the JPMorgan boss warned that the chance of a soft landing was about half of the 70% to 80% odds other forecasters were predicting. He said that was because of several risks still facing the US, including the Fed's tightening campaign, geopolitical conflict, and interest rates, which central bankers have said could remain higher for longer.

Zentner said she was expecting the US to avoid a recession this year as there was no data to support a soon-to-come downturn. But she warned that a hard landing was unavoidable.

""We will have a hard landing at some point. I guarantee you that. We're all wondering: When does that come?"" she said. ""The point that Dimon makes is that there are these cumulative impacts that build over time, and we are in the camp that we haven't yet seen all of the tightening impacts from monetary policy,"" she added, referring to the impact of Fed rate hikes.

Fed officials raised interest rates a whopping 525 basis points in 18 months to tame inflation, a move that's taken borrowing costs in the economy to their highest level since 2001.

Economists have warned that high interest rates could spark a recession as financial conditions become restrictive and that the full impact of rate hikes probably hasn't been felt, as they typically take about 18 months to fully work their way through the economy.

Signs of stress are beginning to show in parts of the financial system. Corporate defaults soared last year to their highest level since the pandemic, according to Moody's Analytics. Bank lending has fallen for three straight quarters, according to Fed data.

Still, signs point to the Fed keeping interest rates elevated as it keeps an eye on inflation. Consumer prices came in hotter than expected last month, with inflation rising 3.1% year-over-year in January.

Zentner predicted that inflation would probably reaccelerate over the first quarter, pointing to the 3.9% growth in core inflation last month. That reacceleration could show up in the next consumer-price-index report, which markets are expecting later this week.

""We do expect inflation reacceleration to be temporary, but that is an open question,"" Zentner said, adding that markets might have to consider Fed rate cuts pushed beyond mid-year.

Investors had been pricing in ambitious rate cuts to come in 2024, but many forecasters have dialed back their expectations amid hot inflation data. Markets are now pricing in a 39% chance that the Fed could lower rates by 100 basis points or more by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",https://i.insider.com/627904e5a6a880001827fe52?width=1200&format=jpeg

Drivers of US growth seen during 1995's soft landing aren't currently present, so government spending may be necessary to buoy GDP, according to Nancy Lazar.

""There could easily be an additional 1.5% boost to GDP from fiscal stimulus this year,"" she wrote.

If the US economy wants to stick a soft landing, the government is going to have to loosen the purse strings.

So says Piper Sandler's chief global economist Nancy Lazar. She argues that without traditional drivers of growth fueling the economy, avoiding a recession will require some fiscal largesse like student-loan-forgiveness plans and tax cuts.

""In order to have a soft landing in 2024, additional fiscal stimulus would be needed (such stimulus definitely kept the economy stronger, longer in 2023),"" Lazar wrote in a note on Monday.

There are three times in history that the US has been able to nail a soft landing: 1967, 1985, and 1995. But Lazar notes that there are certain factors that helped the economy land softly during those eras then that are absent today, like easy commercial-bank-lending standards (present all three times), growing real revenues for corporations (present in 1995), and an uninverted yield curve (present in 1995).

So if those typical boosters of the US economy won't prop up growth in 2024, it'll have to come from somewhere else. That's where the government comes in, according to Lazar.

She says possibile measures include student-loan forgiveness, doling out grants under the CHIPS Act, and proposals like the Wyden-Smith tax cut, which is currently sitting in the Senate. There are also other factors like employment retention credit.

""Putting all the above together, there could easily be an additional 1.5% boost to GDP from fiscal stimulus this year,"" she wrote.

That would raise Piper Sandler's real GDP forecast to a 0.5% expansion this year, instead a 1% contraction. For context, they're on the more bearish end of the spectrum as the Congressional Budget Office currently expects more robust growth of 1.5% in 2024. Meanwhile, economists surveyed by Bloomberg see 2% expansion this year.

One drawback to this approach is that it would make it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates in the face of such a strong economic backdrop. In the previous instance of 1967, Fed Chair Bill Martin boosted GDP, pushed unemployment lower, and sent stocks soaring — hardly conditions conducive for rate cuts.

Lazar cites 1967 as a cautionary tale in the event the Fed enacts fiscal measures to further stimulate the economy. After the late-1960s boom time, the US eventually battled runaway inflation.

""Easing amid material fiscal stimulus risks repeating the Martin Fed's mistake...which set the stage for the 1970s' disastrous inflation cycle,"" she wrote.",https://i.insider.com/654a3d6f36d588dc55cc0d73?width=1200&format=jpeg
