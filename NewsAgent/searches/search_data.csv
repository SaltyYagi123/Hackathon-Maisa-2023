The WiFi aboard the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower isn't exactly the best, but for Capt. Chris Hill, the ship's commanding officer, it's enough to share his thoughts online.

Hill is leading a nuclear-powered carrier, dozens of aircraft, and thousands of sailors through a hot spot in the Red Sea, where fighter jets are always in the air, ready to strike the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen firing missiles into international shipping lanes.

But his social-media posts are often wholesome ones about cookies, dogs, Taco Tuesday, and his sailors, with much less about the fight in which his ship is involved and dealing with daily.

""We have a purpose here and everybody's kind of motivated by that,"" Hill told Business Insider during an interview aboard the Eisenhower last week. ""At the same time, everyone still needs to be loved and valued. So I can provide that as a leader, potentially, but what about the loved ones back home — Mom and Dad, or spouses?""

Hill, a Massachusetts native, assumed command of the Ike nearly a year ago after more than two decades in the Navy. The aircraft carrier deployed to the US European Command area of responsibility in mid-October, and just a few weeks later the ship moved through the Suez Canal and into the Middle East region.

Since then, the Eisenhower has been a lead ship in the US Navy response to the Houthis, who have been launching missile and drone attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Ike's air wing has been involved in striking the rebels directly in Yemen and intercepting threats in the air.

Over the past few months, the ship captain has been posting regularly on his account on X. Since Hill set it up in November, it has picked up more than 64,000 followers. His bio touts his love for the Eisenhower, identifying him as the ""proud Captain of the best damn ship in the Navy.""

He posts frequently about topics including leadership, dogs, and Taco Tuesday. He shares occasional updates on the US Navy's efforts to stem the Houthi threat and images of flight operations on the Ike.

But a cornerstone of his content is the photos of sailors sitting in the captain's chair with cookies in their hands and a heartfelt message home. (This reporter tried several of the cookies, and they are, indeed, excellent.)

For his aircraft carrier to succeed in its mission, Hill said, the crew needs to have high morale, which is rooted in a combination of motivation, pride, and spirit.

Capturing this, he explained, is a two-pronged approach: Sailors need to feel like they're ""loved and valued"" by their leadership, and they need to have a mission and purpose.

""Mission and purpose is actually quite easy out here, because we're doing one of the original functions of the US Navy going back to 1775, which is freedom of navigation,"" Hill said, alluding to the multinational efforts to protect shipping lanes from the Houthis.

He added that the ship's crew is motivated by the task at hand, so the other part of the equation is making sure the crew feels loved and valued. This is where he ropes in families of sailors back home in the US.

Hill said that when he started his account on X, the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter, family members would write to him and say they wanted to see pictures of their sailors. So he decided to call them to the bridge, put them in his captain's chair, give them a cookie, take a picture, and post it online.

The family members enjoyed this, and the requests just kept rolling in.

""The idea is Mom and Dad love the sailor more than I do,"" Hill said. ""So if I can enlist them to be part of my team, sailors will feel loved and valued.""

The efforts to keep morale up come as the Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group confronts a variety of threats, including some no one has ever faced in combat before, in a kinetic-weapons-engagement environment.

Captaining a flagship carrier in this situation is no easy task, but Hill has a lot of Navy experience to lean on.

Among other things, he has served as the executive and commanding officer of an airborne command and control squadron, a TOPGUN instructor, the executive officer of the aircraft carrier George H. W. Bush, and the commanding officer of the amphibious transport dock USS Arlington. He was also involved with Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Inherent Resolve in Afghanistan and against the Islamic State.",https://i.insider.com/65d6463ba3bd891424f8fd44?width=1200&format=jpeg

The exclusive discussions to merge Vodafone Italia and Swisscom’s Fastweb SpA business would create a more efficient company, Swisscom said in a statement on Wednesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The agreement isn’t final and there’s no certainty a deal will go through, the company said.

Vodafone prefers Swisscom’s bid over a previous proposal from Niel’s Iliad because it has a larger cash component, a person familiar with the matter said. The British phone company last month rejected Iliad’s final offer, which proposed forming a joint venture with the Vodafone business in Italy in a bid that included €6.6 billion in cash proceeds for an enterprise value of €10.45 billion.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:

Vodafone’s advanced talks to sell its Italian unit for €8 billion to Swisscom makes its rejection of Iliad’s €10.5 billion JV bid questionable given the latter would result in €6.6 billion in cash and a 50% stake in the combined entity — a riskier but likely more value-accretive option. Swisscom’s offer implies a 7.6x forward EV/Ebitdaal multiple, in line with the 5x-11x comparable M&A range, while reducing leverage 0.4x.

— Erhan Gurses, BI telecoms analyst

Fastweb’s Chief Executive Officer Walter Renna, a company veteran who took the top job in October, is working to maintain the growth his predecessor, Alberto Calcagno, oversaw for 40 consecutive quarters. Revenue rose 6% last year and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and leases gained 3%, according to a statement earlier this month.

Story continues

Vodafone Italia and Fastweb are the country’s second- and fourth-biggest operators, respectively, with combined sales of about €7 billion annually. Italy accounts about 11% of Vodafone’s revenue and is its largest market after Germany and the UK.

The Swisscom offer is expected to face scrutiny of local authorities as well as European ones. Regulators may be less inclined to intervene because Italy would still have four mobile carriers if the deal goes through. Reducing the number to three in a market is seen as a red line for many potential tie-ups.

However, there are signs that the executive branch of the 27-member European Union is easing its position on competition. In Spain, Orange SA’s local unit and Masmovil Ibercom SA won conditional approval from the European Commission last week for a tie-up to create the country’s largest operator after agreeing to certain remedies.

The Vodafone deal is poised to kick off talk of more merger and acquisitions in Italy, one of Europe’s most competitive markets. Iliad’s 2018 entry into the country offering cheaper, no-frills mobile plans helped spark a price war.

Monthly subscriptions for full-fiber landline services, which usually include unlimited Internet, can cost as little as €20 to €25, about a quarter of what most US consumers pay.

Even after its failed attempts to buy Vodafone’s Italian business, Iliad could still pursue deals. Last year Iliad’s country head Benedetto Levi said the phone company would play an active role if M&A opportunities in Italy emerge.

Telecom Italia SpA, the former phone monopoly, is also on the lookout as it awaits the closing of a €22 billion deal to sell its landline grid to KKR & Co, expected this summer.

“We are ready to do our part on M&A activity in the country when we will finalize the KKR deal,” Telecom Italia Chief Executive Officer Pietro Labriola said this month in a conference call with analysts.

CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has considered a number of deals for its Wind Tre SpA unit. In February, it halted a deal to sell a controlling stake in Wind Tre SpA network to buyout firm EQT AB.

In an analysi… [+6778 chars]","As the tech industry rallies around watermarking AI-generated content and other commitments, some experts warn more work needs to be done.

In a new report from Mozilla, researchers suggest popular methods for disclosing and detecting AI content aren’t effective enough to prevent risks related to AI-generated misinformation. In an analysis released today, researchers note current guardrails used by many AI content providers and social media platforms aren’t strong enough to fight malicious actors. Along with “human-facing” methods — such as labeling AI content with visuals or audible warnings — researchers analyzed machine-readable watermarking methods including using cryptography, embedding metadata, and adding statistical patterns.

There are inherent risks related to scaled AI-generated content intersecting with the internet’s current distribution dynamics. Focusing on technical solutions could distract from fixing broader systemic issues such as hyper-targeted political ads, according to Mozilla, which also noted that self-disclosure isn’t enough.

“Social media, a key infrastructure for content circulation, both accelerates and amplifies its impact,” the report’s authors wrote. “Moreover, the well-documented issue of social media platforms algorithmically incentivizing emotional and agitating content could lead to a prioritization of synthetic content distribution, creating a ‘doubling down’ effect.”

According to Mozilla, the best approach is a combination of adding technical solutions and more transparency while also improving media literacy and passing regulations. Mozilla also brought up the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), describing it as a “pragmatic approach” that requires platforms to implement measures without prescribing specific solutions to follow.

Instead of relying on watermarks, some companies are building their own tools for detecting AI-generated deepfakes and other misinformation. Pindrop, an AI audio security provider, has developed a new tool for detecting AI audio based on patterns found in phone calls. The tool, released last week, was made with a data set of 20 million AI audio clips analyzed via more than 100 different text-to-speech tools. Pindrop is known for detecting the recent deepfake robocall resembling President Joe Biden and also discovered audio deepfakes of Anthony Bourdain in the 2021 documentary “Roadrunner.”

The tech looks for audio abnormalities to distinguish whether a call is live or recorded, said Pindrop co-founder and CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan. For example, Pindrop looks for spatial characteristics found in human language like fricatives, which aren’t easily replicated by recordings. It also looks for temporal anomalies such as the shape of a sound made by a mouth saying “hello” or the speed of a word like “ball.”

Although Pindrop claims to have a high accuracy rate, Balasubramaniyan knows it’s a “cat and mouse game,” adding that the key is how quickly companies can react whenever malicious actors move onto newer and better tools. He also noted that transparency and explainability of AI tools are also key.

“A deepfake system sounds like a big monolith, but it’s composed of a lot of individual engines,” Balasubramaniyan told Digiday. “And each of these engines leaves behind telltale features … You need to be able to dissect a deepfake engine into really granular parts and see what signatures each of those granular parts are leaving behind. So even if one portion of it gets changed, the others you still have.”

With prosed IPO, Reddit bets on LLMs

When Reddit filed paperwork last week for its proposed IPO, the company also revealed part of its plans for using large language models — and profiting from them.

In corporate filings with U.S. regulators, Reddit said its massive trove of user content will help train large language models. Reddit had more than “one billion posts and over 16 billion comments” at the end of 2023, according to the filing. That data could be used to train internal models, but will also be used as part of data licensing deals with other companies.

“Reddit data is a foundational piece to the construction of current AI technology and many LLMs,” according to Reddit’s S-1. “We believe that Reddit’s massive corpus of conversational data and knowledge will continue to play a role in training and improving LLMs. As our content refreshes and grows daily, we expect models will want to reflect these new ideas and update their training using Reddit data.”

Last week, Reddit also announced a new deal with Google, which will use Reddit content to train its AI models. Although it didn’t share the terms of the deal, Reuters reported Google will pay $60 million for access to its content. Reddit’s S1 also noted that the company expects revenue from data licensing in 2024 to be a “minimum of $66.4 million.”

Chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini and Anthropic might also compete with Reddit’s main platform, the company said: “Redditors may choose to find information using LLMs, which in some cases may have been trained using Reddit data, instead of visiting Reddit directly.”

Reddit’s IPO filing also provides plenty of information about the company’s advertising business, which accounts for a majority of its revenue. In 2023, revenue totaled $804 million, a 21% increase over 2022’s $667 million.

Google said it is bringing its Gemini models to Performance Max. In addition to upgrading image generation, Gemini also will let advertisers generate long headlines and site links. Another upcoming feature will let advertisers generate lifestyle imagery via Performance Max along with variations for scaled campaigns. Google also faced criticism last week when Gemini’s image generator created images showing people of color wearing Nazi-era uniforms. (Google paused the tool and in a blog post about the issue promised to “do better.”)

Newsguard researchers said they’ve found more than 700 AI-generated websites masquerading as “news.” According to Newsguard, the websites are publishing misinformation and other harmful content in 15 languages. Many also profit from programmatic ads.

The privacy-focused browser Brave added more ways for its AI assistant “Leo” to help users read PDFs, analyze Google Drive files and transcribe YouTube videos. The updates came just a day after Adobe added a new AI assistant to Acrobat and Reader to help generate summaries, analyze documents and find answers.

Pfizer spoke with Digiday about how it developed a new generative AI marketing platform called “Charlie,” which was developed in partnership with Publicis Groupe and named after the pharma giant’s founder.

A group of adtech pioneers has a new AI startup for publishers, according to VentureBeat.

Input/output: Question of the week

Output: As tech companies build out their own large language models and various related AI tools, open source models are also playing a key role beyond closed platforms. Following Meta’s 2023 debut of its open-source Llama 2, Google debuted its own open-source models last week named Gemma.

Last week, the Federal Trade Commission launched a new inquiry into five major AI players to investigate how their investments and partnerships impact competition.

Along with new inquiries for Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, the FTC also is investigating Anthropic and OpenAI. Both startups have received multi-billion-dollar investments from the tech giants. As part of the investigation, the FTC is looking for information about investment and partnership agreements, their rationale and the implications for competition, sales, resources and product rollouts.

During a virtual “Tech Summit” last Thursday, FTC chair Lina Kahn said the agency will look at whether tech giants are using their power to trick the public, and whether the AI investments allow giants to “exert undue influence or gain privileged access” to secure an advantage across the AI sector. Kahn also said the FTC will use findings from previous investigations to guide their strategy, including looking “upstream” at other companies that might be violating U.S. laws. (In 2020, the agency launched a similar inquiry to see if acquisitions by six tech giants harmed competition.)

“Just as we’ve seen behavioral advertising fuel the endless collection of user data, model-training is emerging as another feature that could further incentivize surveillance,” Kahn said. “The FTC’s work has made clear that these business incentives cannot justify violations of the law. The drive to refine your algorithm cannot come at the expense of people’s privacy or security, and privileged access to customers’ data cannot be used to undermine competition.”

The inquiries could also benefit from the FTC’s recently approved use of a subpoena-like legal tool to that aims to make it easier and faster for the agency to obtain documents and testimony during AI investigations.

Another big tech hearing is happening this week in Congress. On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing with the CEOs of five tech giants — Meta, Snap, TikTok, Discord and X — to discuss online child safety on the platforms. While the hearing isn’t focused on AI per se, growing concerns about AI-generated misinformation will likely lead lawmakers to question the executives about what they’re doing to mitigate harmful GenAI ahead of the 2024 elections. And in Europe, last week’s leak of the final text for the 800-page European Union’s AI Act offered a glimpse into how that could guide the EU’s approach to AI regulations.

Existing worries about AI-generated election misinformation are already a reality. Last week, New Hampshire residents received robocalls featuring deepfake audio impersonating President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in the state’s primary. Meanwhile, new research from the Brookings Institution shows how AI on social platforms could affect the 2024 elections and a separate Mozilla report claims ChatGPT flouts its own election policies related to AI-generated content.

Lawmakers also have condemned the explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift that spread rapidly across social media platforms including X and Telegram. In a post on X last week, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, wrote about wanting “to pass Section 230 reform so we can hold tech firms accountable for allowing this disgusting content to proliferate.”

“Sadly, current law may insulate platforms and websites from exactly this sort of accountability,” Warner wrote.

Publicis Groupe announces major AI updates

Last week, Publicis Groupe announced major updates for its AI strategy including a new AI platform called CoreAI and plans to invest €300 million over the next three years. Ahead of the announcement, Digiday interviewed several Publicis Groupe execs about the process of developing CoreAI and numerous partners and data involved. Beyond using consumer intelligence and performance data, Publicis Groupe trained CoreAI on behavioral science data to teach it attitudinal perspective, online and offline behavioral trends, and data sets from internal sources and walled garden partners.

“When you extend that out further, we certainly have quite a robust strategy,” said Sam Levine Archer, chief solutions architect for Publicis North America. “Experience design, measurement and analytics [and] sets of practices throughout the group to observe behaviors and exposure to marketing and behaviors thereafter to see impact. All of that are both structured and unstructured datasets that we have as part of our practice today and that is being included in what’s training our models.”

An alarming new investigation of new registrations for fuel cell electric vehicles in Europe fell into the Intertubes last week with barely a ripple, though it’s not for lack of trying. “Hydrogen vehicle registrations are flatlining across most of Europe” was the headline, which sounds like a good way to get attention. However, so far there hasn’t been much in the way of follow-on news, leaving the situation a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

What Happened To The Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles Of Europe?

Part of the mystery may lie in the fact that headlines by nature don’t include the fine print. The investigation was undertaken by the news organization Hydrogen Insight. Upon taking a deep dive into the details, they noted that the picture on fuel cell vehicles was a mixed bag.

“Data from every European country with at least one HRS [Hydrogen Refueling Station] shows that in all but three, registrations of FCEV have either crashed or stagnated,” Hydrogen Insight explained. They also noted that “registrations can include vehicles purchased by dealerships that have not yet been sold to a business or individual.”

Looking at Germany, the situation does seem dire. Germany is the biggest market for hydrogen cars in Europe, but on January 9, Hydrogen Insight reported that new fuel cell electric vehicle registrations in the country dropped almost 70% in 2023. Switzerland also turned in a dismal performance, registering just 28 cars and 10 commercial vehicles in 2023.

France was one of the bright spots, which is no surprise considering the country’s “Hydrogen Valley” fuel cell promotion program.

“France shows that the country is becoming one of the most dynamic FCEV markets in Europe — although hydrogen vehicle sales are still tiny compared to those of battery-electric equivalents — with the UK and Czechia the only other European nations to have seen more than ten FCEV registrations per HRS last year,” Hydrogen Insights noted.

Why Is This Happening?!?

Despite the bright spots of France, the UK, and Czechia, the Hydrogen Insights investigation paints a gloomy picture overall. The big question is why. The lack of an adequate fueling station network is commonly cited as one of the reasons for the slow pace of fuel cell electric vehicle sales, but reporter Rachel Parkes notes that some of the worst-performing countries on new registrations seem to have an adequate number of fuel stations.

If the lack of a reliable refueling infrastructure is not the problem, other factors could include relatively high costs and unfamiliarity with fuel cell technology. That’s a contrast with battery electric vehicles, which are quickly becoming familiar, ubiquitous, and less costly.

Hydrogen Insight does not venture to guess exactly what drove fuel cell electric vehicle registrations down last year, though the piece does suggest that potential buyers are waiting for bigger subsidies to kick in. Parkes notes that the Dutch government increased its subsidies in September, shortly after the cut-off date for gathering statistics for the investigation.

The financial script flips in the high-end car market, but fuel cell electric vehicles are still out in the cold. If you’re looking for a battery electric car with a fancy hood ornament, you can take your pick from startups like Lucid Air and legacy brands like the Porsche Taycan among many others. In contrast, availability in the fuel cell department is much more limited.

A New Hope For Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles

As for whether or not the overall downswing in European registrations is a matter of temporary circumstances or it signals a long term trend, that remains to be seen. On a sunnier note, the story of 2024 has yet to be written, and three important developments in the fuel cell space kicked off the year.



First, on January 27 we noted that Renault Group’s Hyvia fuel cell vehicle venture announced the delivery of 50 fuel cell vans to the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France. The initial goal is 400 light-duty and 80 heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles, for a total of about 1,000 vehicles over the coming years.

Second, as noted by Hydrogen Insight, Stellantis followed suit just two days later on January 29, announcing that it has expanded its lineup of fuel cell vans, with an initial focus on markets in France and Poland.

“Aimed at supporting intensive customer use, the fuel cell versions of the commercial vans build on the technology used in the zero- emission BEV variants of the vehicles, with the added advantages of short refueling times and no sacrifice of payload capability,” Stellantis noted in a press statement.

“For the mid-size vans, a second generation of the fuel cell system delivers a segment record range of up to 400 km and refueling time of less than four minutes. For the large vans, the addition of fuel cell technology brings range capability of up to 500 km and refueling time of just five minutes,” they added.

The expanded fuel cell lineup includes the Citroën ë-Jumpy and ë-Jumper, the Fiat Professional E-Scudo and E-Ducato, the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro and Movano, and the Peugeot E-Expert and E-Boxer.

As for where the fuel is coming from, Stellantis has already nailed that down. “In 2023, Stellantis became an equal one-third shareholder in Symbio, a leading hydrogen technology company with operations in Europe and the United States,” they explained.

To be clear, Stellantis is not giving up its commitment to battery electric vehicle mobility. However, the company does note that hydrogen fuel cell technology “plays an important role in the Stellantis zero-emission propulsion roadmap.”

Here Come The Fuel Cell Vehicles

As if on cue, immediately after Stellantis announced its expanded fuel cell van lineup, the company reportedly sold 150 of the electric vehicles to the green hydrogen producer Hysata, a newly launched joint venture between Toyota and Air Liquide.

Meanwhile, a third significant development occurred over here in the US last week, when General Motors and Honda revved up operations at their FCSM 50-50 joint venture in Brownstown, Michigan, describing it as “the first large-scale manufacturing joint venture to build fuel cells.”

The new factory brings to fruit a fuel cell electric vehicle collaboration between the two companies that began in 2013. On the all-important cost-cutting side, GM anticipates that the new FCSM fuel cell systems will be about 66% less expensive relative to the one sported by the 2019 Honda Clarity fuel cell electric vehicle.

GM attributes the new benchmark to “lowering development and manufacturing costs by leveraging economies of scale, advancing the cell design, simplifying supporting auxiliary equipment, utilizing common sourcing, and reducing the use of costly precious metals.”

No word yet on exactly what kinds of electric vehicles will be in play. Stationary applications could make an appearance as well. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.

When we made the announcement, we knew this change would require a big transition for us and for our on-premises customers, but we also knew that it would mean exponential benefits helping us to drive the future of teamwork. Now, we are here: Server support ends on Feb 15, 2024.

What happens to your Server instances after Feb 15, 2024? Your products won’t be eligible for renewal or receive updates, enhancements, or security patches. Over time, this may lead to performance and compatibility issues with evolving technologies, posing security and operational risks for your organization. Act now to mitigate these concerns. Which products does Server end of support apply to? Jira Software Server

Jira Core Server

Jira Service Management Server

Confluence Server

Bitbucket Server

Crowd Server

Bamboo Server

Atlassian-built Server apps What to do next To remain supported, we recommend migrating to Cloud or upgrading to Data Center. Visit the Atlassian Migration Program to explore your options and learn how to take the next step.

Today, the Atlassian Cloud powers more than 290,000 customers like NASA, Reddit, Rivian, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd, and Paypal. Our customers now have more seats on the Atlassian Cloud than on Data Center and Server combined, and 94% of all of our customers have a Jira Software, Confluence, and/or a Jira Service Management presence on Cloud. Our Cloud products are built on Atlassian’s platform, enabling seamless cross-product experiences that empower teams to move faster, collaborate more efficiently, and accelerate speed to value.

We’re thrilled to share the progress we’ve made, the incredible results our customers are seeing, and help you take the next step to remain supported.

How the Atlassian Cloud has matured since October 2020

Removing barriers to your path to cloud

Over the past three years, we’ve been laser-focused on building an enterprise-grade cloud platform for effective teamwork that meets your requirements. We’ve increased the scale of our cloud products, met critical regulatory compliance standards, and strengthened data security.

As we’ve knocked down barriers to your cloud transformation, we have seen rising adoption from highly regulated industries (e.g. Healthcare: Castlight, CHG Healthcare, Financial Services: EMC Insurance, EQ Bank, Finoa, SunLife, Edenred, Government: UK Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency) and highly regulated regions (e.g. the European Union: Software AG, Voith).

Ensuring a smooth migration process

To support your migration process, we introduced the Atlassian Migration Program : your one-stop shop for migration guidance, free tooling, support, and promotions. We’ve upgraded our tools to enable faster data transfer to cloud, with Jira Cloud Migration Assistant (JCMA) now 6x faster and Confluence Cloud Migration Assistant (CCMA) 24x faster. We’ve also bolstered their reliability, achieving a 33% improvement in JCMA and 12% in CCMA plan success rates.

Driving next-gen teamwork through Automation, Analytics and Intelligence

The value realized once you’re in the Atlassian Cloud is clear. No-code automation , built-in insights and analytics, streamlined collaboration with smart links, and Atlassian Intelligence enable your teams around the globe to work faster and smarter together.

In addition to all the benefits offered by Atlassian’s platform, each product has significantly evolved. Get real-time insights on your team’s work so you can optimize how work gets done, report on team health, and remove bottlenecks using Jira Software insights . Effortlessly manage content, organize spaces, and notify teams of updates using Confluence automation . And service internal and external customers effectively with AI -powered virtual agents in Jira Service Management .

Reaping the benefits; customer stories and metrics

If you’re still not convinced cloud is the future, let our customers tell you in their own words. Over 450 companies surveyed post-migration have reported greater productivity and collaboration:

Roblox migrated to stay ahead of fast growth and industry movement toward cloud technology, and to enjoy the superior user experience.

Before, our team saw Atlassian as individual tools…Now, [features and integrations] like Jira macros and Smart Links have really been pivotal in collaboration, productivity, & discoverability.” Roblox

Since migrating to Atlassian Cloud, Sun Life has captured hundreds of thousands of dollars in time savings in less than a year, achieved 97% user satisfaction scores, and created a more agile, collaborative working environment that will help ensure their next 150+ years are just as successful as their last.

Jira Cloud and Confluence Cloud are a big step in the right direction from the on-premise versions and the other previous tools we were using. All the new functionality really improved my day to day.” Sun Life

Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd, an early adopter of Atlassian’s technology, gets an invaluable end-to-end view across the entire business. Plus, implementing Atlassian Intelligence into workflows has already improved productivity across product teams, with one manager sharing that he saved over two hours just within the first week he used it.

In my day-to-day work, Atlassian Intelligence acts as a virtual teammate that summarizes 5-page PIR reports into 5-sentence recaps for me, so I can get up to speed quickly ahead of monthly review meetings. It’s already proven its worth by improving productivity across our product teams.” Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd

The dust is settling on the AW24 men’s and couture seasons, with the fashion set arriving home to unpack and get through their washing in the two short weeks before the womenswear circus begins. Before that kicks off in NY next week, though, we’ve recapped everything you need to see from the men’s shows. Read on for the lowdown, and don’t forget to hit follow on Dazed Fashion for real-time updates and more.

MARTINE ROSE’S SURPRISE PARIS PARTY

Courtesy of Martine Rose

Martine Rose’s sporadic approach to showing her collections sees her landing on the fashion calendar as and when she feels like it, so it’s always an exciting proposition to find out she’s got a spot on the schedule (and a slightly more boring one when she’s not). This season, though, there was zero warning that she’d be uprooting from London and making an appearance in Paris for the first time, with ‘a screening’ of a new film the only thing flagged to be happening. To be fair, there was a screening, with Rose taking over the crowded upstairs of a seedy little balloon-strewn Pigalle club to give a new film its big premiere, but what wasn’t anticipated was that said film would burst out of the projector and into real life, as her rag-tag community of models tramped out from backstage as part of a night that was part-runway impromptu show, part-Vogue ball, and part-raucous family party. The clothes themselves, meanwhile, were business as usual, with the beloved British designer’s offbeat tailoring and twisted trackies rubbing up against Rose-branded football shirts, battered moto leather, and various uniforms and workwear: the male-presenting model in a skimpy corset that barely covered his nips, baggy workers trousers bearing reflective strips and a brilliantly ratty little faux fur coat was a particular highlight.

GOING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE WITH RICK OWENS

Rick Owens was one of the few designers to respond to the current state of the world, and particularly, seemingly, to the current war happening in Palestine, in a direct way, as he moved his AW24 show from his usual space at the Palais De Tokyo into his Paris home, and the place where his eponymous brand found its feet over 25 years ago. What followed was truly special, as guests filed in from the snow to cups of steaming coffee and the opportunity to have a snoop around the designer’s uber-minimalist space – all white walls, parquet floors, and esoteric, one-off furniture pieces. The show itself felt just as magic as the out-of-the-ordinary moment: as the sun streamed in through the gleaming sash windows and the ice began to thaw, Owens sent one of his most inspiring collections to date out through the space, with his pumped-up coats, angular, imposing tailoring, and spidery knits offset by big inflated boots created in collaboration with artist Straytukay. Always pretty mind-blowing as it is, in this setting Owens’ clothes felt even more like art than usual.

LOUIS GABRIEL NOUCHI’S FIRST FORAY INTO WOMENSWEAR

2024 ANDAM winner Louis Gabriel Nouchi has been hellbent on making men of all shapes and sizes look smoking hot for a few years now, but this season he saw fit to branch out into womenswear, sending a BDSM-tinged collection of 80s and 90s-inspired power suiting, cinched tranches, and his signature sexy underwear out onto the runway for AW24. All set to a skewed slice of the Succession soundtrack, Nouchi’s cast pummelling the runway were joined by Drag Race icon Raja, whose silvery hair, slouchy suit and glass of champagne clutched firmly in hand sent the internet into a meme tailspin. The kicker was the closer, though, as Coco Rocha stormed through the show space in a high-shine, wipe-clean vinyl trench and sexy, severe pointed boots: a look that was a need, not a want.

THOSE WILD NEW SHOES AT COMME DES GARÇONS

Rei Kawakubo was in a reflective mood this season, turning out a collection of mostly white and muted clothes – it was, what she called, a moment of peace and purity in a world in turmoil. Where things got batshit, though, was at the model’ feet: with the revered Japanese designer debuting steadily more mad shoes across the course of the last few shoes (who could forget those double-Oxfords?), this time around the classic brogues had been chucked onto the catwalk before the leather offcuts from the sole had been removed. With chic uppers bearing clean snake and crocodile prints, they’re surely a style that will get the real heads salivating.

PRETTY LITTLE KITTIES AT GIVENCHY

It’s been a hot minute since Matthew Williams skipped out of his role as creative director at Givenchy and into the sunset, and right now, there’s only speculative whispers of who might take the top spot at the house (a certain ex-McQueen designer is top of the rumour mill, FYI). Taking on the challenge of the tough in-betweener collection, then, was Givenchy’s in-house team, who invited the fashion crowd into their atelier and loaded them up with champagne before debuting their anonymous efforts. In the team’s hands, the collection was multi-textured and refined, with spidery knitted scarves layered over slick bombers, precise suits matched with tactile sweaters, and heavyweight outerwear offset with playful flourishes, like the little fuzzy kittens that peeked out from the fabrics.

KENZO’S NEW ERA

Photography Eseniya Araslanova

It wasn’t just Dazed’s fashion director who was busy this season, but our editor-in-chief put a good stint in during the menswear shows, too. Joining forces with fashion legend Nigo at Kenzo, IB Kamara stamped his signature all over the Japanese designer’s latest collection, which got its debut in a library – models carried tattered copies of books in little leather straps, because as we all know, reading is fundamental and beauty is more than skin deep. On the line-up for the AW24 season were neat little suits with cropped cuffs and hems, slinky pencil dresses cinched with waist belts, and slouchy librarian-esque cardis layered over strappy little tops and prim blouses. It was sexier and more grown-up this season, but there were plenty of signature Nigo trademarks to get excited about, like the cute logo souvenir jackets and collegiate stamping. The library is open.

THE PERFECT NEW FASHION UNION AT BALMAIN

Balmain arrived back on the Paris Men’s schedule this season with a bang, forgoing its recent salon and showroom forays for a blowout runway show closed by none other than Olivier Rousteing’s good pal Naomi Campbell. With Balmain never really about the ‘quiet luxury’ that’s currently dominating the catwalks, the collection came supercharged, with slick, glamorous tailoring hashed out in a bolshy, Stabilo-inflected colour palette. Best of all, though – and yes, we may be biased – was the perfect union between Rousteing and Dazed fashion director Imruh Asha, whose distinctive fingerprints could be seen through the whole collection via its finishing flourishes – the Dutch creative behind some of the most original campaigns and shoots in recent years was brought on board to rev up the collection and bring it to life through his own unique eye.

BERET MET BOJAGI AT WOOYOUNGMI

As Seoul has emerged as a fashion capital worth keeping an eye on over the past decade, how South Korean fashion interacts with its European counterparts has become increasingly important. And what better than a Korean-based, Paris-founded label to immortalise this on the catwalk? “As a Far-Eastern urban culture in constant conversation with those of the West, the dress codes of Seoul inherently cross-pollinate South Korean and European wardrobe traditions,” read the Wooyoungmi notes, mailed out before the show. So with this in mind, Madame Woo connected the dots between Paris and Seoul for the day, presenting a collection of modern menswear essentials with a twin city twist. Scarves printed with Parisian cityscapes lay over the shoulders of some models, while rugby shirts were embroidered with the portmanteau ‘PariSeoul’. Oversized suede jackets you might catch a uni professor in came with patches showing the Eiffel and N Seoul Towers side by side – but it was the headgear which was a particular standout. Some model’s heads came topped with Bojagi knots – the Korean art of fabric wrapping – which at points looked like Woo’s own inspired take on the French beret. THE MACLACHLANAISSANCE CONTINUES AT UNDERCOVER

Of late, Kyle MacLachlan has been experiencing a renaissance. That’s not to say that Orson Hodge hasn’t always been king, it’s just that, recently, his social media presence has been particularly unhinged, waving around a cardboard gun and pretending to do coke on main (“Congrats to the teenage girl recently hired by Kyle MacLachlan to direct his social media presence”, read one inspired tweet). And if Undercover’s AW24 offering is anything to go by, Jun Takahashi might just be clairvoyant, because his new collection has MacLachlan all over it – quite literally. This season, Takahashi mined Twin Peaks for reference, showing shirts, blazers, denim and coats with patches of MacLachlan’s Agent Cooper stitched into their fabric. One standout piece comes in the form of a black bomber jacket with an almost-life-sized Cooper bust in jacquard on its reverse. Elsewhere, Takahashi transfers Lynch’s sinister tale to other garments too, with images of a dead Laura Palmer and prints of spooky pines – but it’s the inclusion of MacLachlan which makes this a damn fine collection. WINNIE EXPANDS THE HYPEBEAST’S HEADWEAR

If you head to any of the “trendy” neighbourhoods in fashion-conscious cities, you won’t be able to move for the men in faux-fur trappers. They’ve had London in a chokehold for quite a few seasons now, and been shown on the catwalk at labels as diverse as Burberry and Julien Dossena for JPG. This season however, WINNIE’s Idris Balogun is here to expand the possibilities of faux-fur headwear for those men who might be stuck in a bit of a rut. There were mink-coloured creations, perched on top like a crown, a towering grey version that engulfed its model’s head, and a brown bear variation with tiers like a cake. The trapper was still there, but refashioned in shearling instead, and flat caps and slouchy beanies also appeared for an altogether different choice. It makes sense for Balogun to take a current trend and reappropriate it for a new kind of man: the collection was inspired by the poet and artist Ted Joans, a participant of the 1950s Beat Generation, which was all about experimentation, liberation and rejection of the status quo. THE STYLING AT NAMESAKE WAS ON POINT

This season, the Taiwanese label founded by brothers Michael, Richard and Steve Hsieh explored the idea of growing up, as the sporting codes of the brand expanded to include more mature silhouettes. Billowing trousers came with matching sleeveless smocks, basketball shorts were printed with flower illustrations and a gentleman’s dressing gown was made from tech material you’d find at Sports Direct. Dazed fave Jamie-Maree Shipton made particularly good calls on the styling throughout, looping beaded statement necklaces around model’s necks, and layering loose trousers under structured jorts. Similarly, the first model that walked onto the catwalk was holding a basketball jersey over his arm, in the way that a young waiter would, or maybe a maître d’. This gestural styling feels fitting for a brand like Namesake (which was founded by the Hsiehs in tribute to their father), using the physical basketball jersey as a symbol of service and support. THE ARGYLE GLITCHWEAR AT HERMÈS

For a while now, fashion designers have been glitching out. Jonathan Anderson sent that pixelated hoodie down Loewe’s catwalk for SS23, which birthed its own capsule of bags and t-shirts. Over at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell introduced ‘Damoflage’ for SS24, a new version of LV’s Damier check rendered in pixelated camouflage. And now, Véronique Nichanian has entered the chat. Two thirds of the way through Hermès’ most recent men’s show, some Argyle knitwear appeared on the catwalk, but with a digital twist. Instead of the usual cross-hatched diamonds we’re used to seeing, some of them had been stitched with horizontal bars, like the fuzzy lines on a broken TV. At points the lines bled out of the Argyle and into the grey space of the knit, while another iteration of the pattern came in a CMYK colour scheme. Much like Silvia Fenturini over at Fendi, Nichanian created her own “English fantasy” for the rest of the collection, combining classic suiting with herringbone tweed – but the inclusion of glitchwear proves that even this 186-year-old heritage house can’t escape the looming influence of the digital world. ISSEY MIKAYE CUSHIONS THE BLOW

Life can be hard. Sometimes, all you want to do is put on a cosy jumper, curl up between the sofa cushions, and forget the world exists. Well, if you feel comforted by that admittedly quite sad thought, Issey Miyake has you covered. For this season’s Homme Plissé collection, Satoshi Kondo found inspiration in front of the TV, sending models down the catwalk holding a selection of scatter cushions. First, they were clasped to stomachs as some sort of squashy breastplate, protecting their holder from the outside world. Then, their spongy innards disappeared, falling to sides as makeshift clutch bags. And lastly, straps were stitched on to transform the cover into a canvas tote. The cushions – and the rest of the collection for that matter – were decorated with the brushstrokes of French artist Ronan Bouroullec, who worked alongside the Miyake team to show that clothes can be the canvas for creative freedom. After the show, it was revealed that the cushions were actually pouches containing foldaway coats, which makes perfect sense – comfort has always been the highest priority for the Miyake man.

X

X News Daily posted that X is updating its Explore page. The platform will display trending topic summaries created by its AI tool Grok. User @swak_12 noted on X that the new Explore page sectioncould replace the current What’s Happening section located on the home timeline.

In other news, X announced on a company blog that it’s debuting a new Creator Targeting program. Creator Targeting will let advertisers place ads “against a curated list of premium content creators via Creator Targeting,” according to the announcement. Creator Targeting works in addition to X’s primary brand safety solutions, Sensitivity Settings and Adjacency Controls. The platform will soon feature ads on an individual creator’s profile “completely eliminating the unlikely event of unwanted adjacencies while aligning your brand to creators you love most,” according to X. Creator Targeting is described as an extension of X’s Amplify Pre-roll program, which got off to a shaky start after MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, seemingly received preferential treatment with his initial post.

Meta

Social Media Today reported that Meta is testing a Verified comment-filtering process on Instagram. This would allow users to surface comments from blue check-marked accounts first, which could help them prioritize responding to these comments from verified humans.

Threads

Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, posted on Threads that the platform is finally testing a much-requested trending topics feature. “Today’s topics on Threads will be on the search page and in the For You feed. The topics are determined by our AI systems based on what people are engaging with right now on Threads,” Mosseri wrote.

A Threads post indicated that the platform is conducting some fact-checking. The notice reads: “The same false information was reviewed in another thread by fact-checkers. There may be small differences. Independent fact-checkers say this information has no basis in fact.” Keep an eye out for more of these as we enter election season.

Instagram

Social media expert Matt Navarra posted on Threads that Instagram seems to be testing the limit on how many hashtags users can add to a post. An image in the post featured six hashtags with a notification at the bottom that says, “You can only add 5 hashtags to this post.”

In other news, Jonah Manzano, social media enthusiast and singer-songwriter, posted on Threads that Instagram is letting users take video cutouts and turn them into stickers. Instagram already announced photo cutouts last month. To create a sticker, select a video or photo “with one distinct object.” See the process here.

Mosseri posted a video on Instagram announcing that the platform is updating the direct message process for creators by adding a filter for people you follow. “Because maybe you DM a lot of people you don’t follow yet, negotiating deals, figuring out collaborations, but sometimes you just want to focus the experience on people you know in order to make the experience a bit safer and more positive,” Mosseri said.

App trendspotter Radu Oncescu posted on Threads that Instagram is testing video carousels of Reels on Android.

TikTok

Next month, TikTok will debut a local language Election Centre in the app for nations in the EU ahead of the union’s June elections, according to a TikTok newsroom announcement. “This initiative is just one element of a wider strategy to ensure that TikTok remains a creative, safe, and civil place for our community during the election period,” the announcement noted. Some feature initiatives include:

Policy enforcement: Over 6,000 people moderate EU language content along with technological tools to enforce rules and root out “covert influence operations.”

Handling misinformation: Misinformation moderators who have specialized training will take down problematic content, working alongside experts who can add local knowledge to capture the full nuance of each market.

Media literacy: TikTok launched media literacy campaigns last year in 18 European countries to address misinformation. There are nine more campaigns on tap this year.

LinkedIn

LinkedIn announced a Media Planning API tool to help agencies. When creating a brand campaign, an agency can use the API to understand the “forecasted reach and frequency of brand campaigns before spending any budget.”

YouTube

Creator Insider announced updates to mobile, posts-only feeds and free creator gifting elements. Creators can now upload videos or Shorts directly from YouTube Studio mobile. Creators can also set the video’s monetization status from YouTube Studio.

The platform also built out a posts-only feed for iOS and Android mobile devices. Users can access this feed by selecting the “view all posts” link on the community posts in the home tab. After tapping that button, users will be able to see posts from channels they’ve viewed previously or posts the platform thinks you’ll fancy.

The platform also launched affiliate product tagging on livestreams. Creators in the YouTube shopping affiliate program can tag products from involved merchants directly in their livestreams. Creators can promote products in long-form videos, livestreams and shorts. When creators tag products featured in their own livestreams, a shopping button will pop up to create a more engaging way to shop. Creators can also pin products during livestreams.

The YouTube Official Blog announced that creators can add some extra flair to their Shorts with music video remixes. Go to YouTube and hit the “Remix” button to choose from one of four remix options: Green Screen, Sound, Cut and Collab. Here are the feature deets:

Users can use the sound from a video as a soundtrack.

Make a Short right next to the video featuring the artist.

Green Screen. Let the video be your next Short background and film your reaction.

Cut a scene from the music vid and add it to a Short.

Pinterest

Lindsey Gamble, associate director of Influencer Innovation at Later, posted on Threads that Pinterest updated its Business Manager feature (formerly known as Business Access) to create and share assets like profiles and ad accounts, assign partner and employee permissions, and more. “This is a long-awaited update, as Pinterest now has similar capabilities to Meta and TikTok’s Business Managers, making it easier for brands/agencies to collaborate,” Gamble said. “It should lead to more paid media amplification of Pinterest creator content, too.”

The new features include:

Audience sharing to repeat popular social media tactics on other accounts.

Asset groups. Make custom groups according to needs by brand, product line or language.

Two-factor authentication. Business owners can make employees use a two-factor authentication process to access assets, according to Pinterest.

It was another week of bad headlines in the games industry, with Eidos Montreal layoffs on Monday and a brief reprieve on Tuesday before Wednesday brought stories of Sega, Nimble Giant, GameSpot, and Artificer all cutting staff, and Square Enix's Tokyo RPG Factory closing entirely. Thursday we had layoffs at Airship Syndicate.

It's ugly out there, and it's been ugly for about a year now. You don't need me to tell you that.

This feels like the worst it's been in terms of layoffs since I started covering the industry side of games in 2005. The only thing I've seen come close was the 2008 financial crisis era, which saw giants like Sony and EA shedding staff like my old roommate's cat shed hair. (I know you don't know my old roommate or his cat, but it really was a spectacular amount).

The rush of horrible news isn't the only thing about this year that feels similar to 2008

The financial crisis claimed a host of operations large and small, from industry institutions like Midway and Electronic Gaming Monthly to well-regarded studios like Free Radical Design, Factor 5, and MS Flight Sim developer Aces Game Studio.

The rush of horrible news isn't the only thing about this year that feels similar to then. Because for all the hand-wringing, the basic business of games is trundling along just fine thank you very much, much as it was in 2008.

STAT | $21 billion – The NPD Group's US game industry software and hardware sales total for 2008, the largest it had ever been to that point.

STAT | $57.2 billion – Circana's US consumer spending on games total for 2023. That's not quite a record, as 2021 just barely topped $60 billion, but 2023 is still the second-best year on record for US spending on games. Last year was even slightly better than 2020's $56.9 billion, which you might remember benefitted from that whole pandemic-keeping-people-stuck-at-home-with-nothing-to-do-for-months-at-a-time thing.

And while we're unlikely to see any Activision Blizzard-scale acquisitions in the near-term, or even the ill-advised venture capital largesse of the blockchain and metaverse manias, people are clearly still willing to put money into games.

QUOTE | ""There still is plenty of cash, plenty of interest, and plenty of willingness to do deals on the part of not only strategic buyers that we all know, but also private equity companies and other large financial institutions that want to get exposure to games."" – At the Montreal International Games Summit last November, Agnitio Capital founder Shum Singh assured the developers in the audience that people still want to invest in games; they're just going to actually do their due diligence first.

STAT | 5 – The number of stories we had this week of studios finding new investment, including Carry1st, 8SEC, Loric Games, Order of Meta, and Mountaintop. Last week we saw investment into True Gamers, Obelisk Studio, and Talofa Games. And we've also been given a heads up on more funding news expected to arrive next week.

Add to that a smattering of newly established operations like Roro, Shapeshifter Games, Megabit, Narwhal Accelerator, ForthStar Games, Moonlight Studios, Hundred Star Games, and Astra Logical, and there are still a fair number of people out here in 2024 committing resources to fledgling game companies.

On top of that, the industry is expected to continue growing over the coming years, albeit at a more modest pace than in the pre-pandemic years. People still play a lot of games, and they spend a lot of money doing so. They will continue to spend lots of money on games in the future. The heart of the business is just fine, thanks.

If you want a few more reasons for positivity, our own Chris Dring today just posted a look at seven trends and events that could move the needle for the industry, from Nintendo's Switch successor to regulators opening up Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems so developers don't need to fork over 30% of their revenues straight away.

And as for the onslaught of layoffs stories, at this point some of that is self-reinforcing. I'm not just talking about layoff contagion, where highly paid executives abdicate all decision-making ability and just follow the crowd because of C-suite peer pressure. I'm also talking about basic news judgment here.

There have always been layoffs in the games industry. There has not always been thorough coverage of layoffs in the games industry

There have always been layoffs in the games industry. There has not always been thorough coverage of layoffs in the games industry. Even in recent years, the coverage of job cuts is far from what I would consider comprehensive.

It's entirely possible for companies to sweep some cuts under the rug, which is why you get Naughty Dog pressuring employees to keep quiet about layoffs for a couple dozen people and Riot Games admitting it was announcing its 530 layoffs last week because it was just too big a cut to get away with unnoticed.

But layoffs are the story of the moment. Employees (and ex-employees) are more likely to take news of these cuts to social media or the press, and the press is more likely to cover them because they play into a Big Ongoing Story.

Kotaku even has one big layoff story that it just updates with each new cut. I can't speak for another outlet's editorial decisions, but I suspect if this were almost any other year, Kotaku wouldn't be covering the layoffs of fewer than 10 people from 31st Union, a AAA studio that hasn't yet shipped a game (we also covered it), or indie studio Funselektor laying off three people (which we did not cover until this sentence).

The bar for what constitutes a newsworthy layoff is probably lower than in years past because the layoff trend is making them more newsworthy. It's a flaw in the way journalism works that the criteria for a news outlet's judgment on what is worth covering depends on what's happening, but our understanding of what's happening is heavily informed by what's being covered.

This can unfortunately be exploited to terrible ends, where outlets operating in bad faith can make a non-issue into a ""public debate"" that dominates headlines during an electrion season. But it can also happen organically, and in some cases make people's perceptions about a bad situation even worse than reality would support.

Sometimes the media gives a downsizing a little more attention than it rightfully deserves.

None of this is to say that everything is great, actually, or that people's fears are unjustified. Inflation is a real problem and it's hitting basically everyone regardless of industry. But many of the problems affecting games at the moment are not some unavoidable macroeconomic headwind; they are fundamentally direct consequences of actions people in the industry have been taking for years.

They are problems of businesses that badly misread what was happening in the pandemic and believed people would continue to accelerate their spend on video games even after they had the option of resuming their old leisure patterns. This idea of competing against ""going outside"" is particularly challenging when you consider the most popular and lucrative business models in gaming depend on maximizing engagement and playtime. They aren't just competing for people's money; they're competing for their time.

Many of the problems affecting games at the moment are not macroeconomic headwinds; they are consequences of actions people in the industry have been taking for years

They are problems of businesses that willfully lost money quarter-in and quarter-out in reckless pursuit of growth, confident that they could flip a switch and become profitable on demand. Oops.

They are problems of businesses expanding into new fields where they lacked expertise, fields that were often unproven or had entrenched competition that these newcomers would have to steal market share from (some of which were only entrenched because they were among those eager money-losers, making them doubly difficult to compete against).

They are problems of an investment community that got burned by augmented reality, blockchain, and the metaverse that is either beginning to learn its lesson or simply doesn't have the bankroll to chase the current Next Big Things with the same exuberance.

They are problems of an executive herd mentality, where nobody cares about running a sustainable business for years and then suddenly everybody cares about it, where laying off people by the thousands – a literally life-threatening action given the way the US ties your health care to continued employment – is seen as shrewd business rather than a cruel act sometimes taken needlessly by wildly profitable companies, or evidence of tremendous mismanagement when it came to staffing levels.

None of this had to happen this way. There were plenty of people warning that the pandemic bump was temporary, that blockchain was a pyramid scheme without a use case, that augmented reality wasn't ready for prime time, and that ""the metaverse"" was an ill-defined goal functionally indistinguishable from the online communities we've had for decades. (Those are all links to GamesIndustry.biz editorials, but it's not like we were alone in pointing this stuff out.)

And for some of those other things, like the idea that maybe a business should probably turn a profit at some point, I'm going to guess these executives were exposed to such radical ideas at some point on their way to getting an MBA.

But to paraphrase Upton Sinclair (no relation), it is very hard to get an executive to understand something when their bonus depends on them not understanding it.

Even so, I'm optimistic about the industry because I know that the fundamentals are solid and the suffering we see now is the direct result of individuals' bad choices. It's awful, and there's ample room to be angry that the people who led us to this are largely keeping their jobs even as they take away the jobs of hundreds or even thousands of people who worked for them.

But the bad news is temporary because these companies are in the business of selling games, and business remains good. And even in the midst of this span of dismally depressing headlines, there's still good news to be found, with more reliably on the way.

How do they like them Apple Vision Pros?

Apple's new headset fulfills the user fantasy of sitting at home playing a video game on a big TV

It's kind of remarkable that there's this much pessimism around the industry right now at the same time that Apple is making its long-awaited arrival into the VR/AR market with the Apple Vision Pro, which launches today.

When I say long-awaited, I'm not kidding. People were buzzing when Apple hired a VR expert in 2016, and the first report we saw of Apple readying an AR headset goes back to 2017.

Practically every AR market assessment of the past decade has been made with one eye on a hypothetical Apple entry, and now it's finally here but the buzz has been somewhat muted and the reviews are… predictable?

It's Apple, so the price is going to be high. $3,500 in this case, and reviewers seemed split on whether that was expensive, or unbelievably expensive.

And to think people were concerned VR headsets wouldn't look cool.

But it's Apple, so some of the tech and design will really impress. The Vision Pro headset got lots of love for its high-quality screens (the user-facing ones, at any rate) and some reviewers were quite pleased with the hand-tracking gesture controls and floating windows.

But it's also VR (or AR or XR or MR, if you insist these are all very different things and not just marketing terms for a convergent group of products), so there's going to be talk about weight, battery life, and nausea ad nauseum.

There was also another very clear theme, that the Vision Pro is only the beginning of the line here, and its problems would be improved upon in later iterations.

QUOTE | ""Apple's headset has all the characteristics of a first-generation product: It's big and heavy, its battery life sucks, there are few great apps and it can be buggy. And come on, have you seen what this thing thinks I look like?"" – Wall Street Journal tech columnist Joanna Stern, taking exception to the virtual 3D ""persona"" the Vision Pro makes of the user for video chat functionality.

QUOTE | ""Apple's real opportunity will materialize when it finds a way to mass produce the Vision Pro at closer to $2,000, or less. Until then, it may be a niche product. But the experience blows everything else out of the water. It's Apple's most exciting product in years and it's the best example yet that this will become a new way of computing."" – CNBC's Todd Haselton

Haselton genuinely seemed to like the Vision Pro, but I have to say, ""Apple's most exciting product in years"" doesn't say much at all. What's the competition there? Iterative updates to laptops, phones, and tablets? HomePod? The Apple Watch was almost nine years ago already, and ""exciting"" is not the first word that springs to mind when I think about it.

And then there was CNET's Scott Stein, whose amazement at the Vision Pro is either evidence that you really have to try the Vision Pro yourself to fully get it, or a loving write-up of the emperor's new clothes.

QUOTE | ""I've been trying the Vision Pro as my own computer and it feels like monitors all around me. Over to my left is a 3D golf game. To my right is a floating set of photos. I've paired a Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. I can float a TV. I can ask Siri to start playing some music. I can see my keyboard keys and the trackpad… There's an odd struggle, still, between virtual and real. But it's crazy how much does work. I'm writing this on a new product that hasn't even launched yet, and it already feels pretty powerful."" – CNET's review of the Apple Vision Pro

To contrast that, I've been trying my computer as my own computer for decades now, and it feels like I have monitors all around me too. I have easy access to games, music, and photos; I've even paired a keyboard and mouse with it. I can see my keyboard keys and mouse pad. It's quite reasonable how much of this works. I'm writing this on an old product that launched a long time ago, and it feels pretty powerful. I think it can even run Crysis.

Finally, a work computer that can identify your surreptitious rude hand gestures during boring meetings and inform the boss when you completely dissociate and stare into nothing for five minutes!

And as impressive as things like the video passthrough and the hand- and eye-tracking are, they still aren't quite good enough to replace the interfaces we already use on smartphones and PCs, at least in the estimation of The Verge editor-in-chief Nillay Patel.

QUOTE | ""There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they're all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can't ever be executed well enough to become mainstream."" – The Verge's review

Patel wraps up with a list of tradeoffs the Vision Pro has, tradeoffs that seem likely to impact any iterative approach on the headset. It's a computer that messes up your hair and makeup, that won't work as well in a dark room, a very expensive monitor with no HDMI inputs and no ability to easily show other people what you're looking at.

QUOTE | ""And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You're in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I've come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating."" – Patel in the wrap-up of his review.

I haven't actually tried the Vision Pro myself yet, but judging by the things these reviews say do and don't work well, it doesn't sound like this is the thing that will move VR or AR from the future to the present.

The rest of the week in review

STAT | $21.9 billion – Microsoft's net income last quarter, up 33% year-over-year.

STAT | 1,900 – The number of people Microsoft laid off from its gaming business last week.

STAT | 49% - Konami's gaming business posted profits of $380.1 million last quarter, up 49% year-over-year. Sales were up 10.8%.

QUOTE | ""There's not a lot of people that look like me, and I'm trying to be part of that change as well."" – Curtis Baxter, senior writer at Cliffhanger Games on Black Panther, is our first developer featured in this month's Black Voices Progress Report.

QUOTE | ""My philosophy is to remember that we're learning about something new when we make heroes. We have this opportunity to learn about a new culture. By no means am I an expert. But did I walk out of this experience knowing much more than I knew before going into it? Absolutely."" – In a feature on the creation of Overwatch 2's Samoan hero Mauga, Blizzard's Kenny Hudson discusses the developer's efforts to respectfully represent people from under-represented cultures in gaming.

QUOTE | ""We believe constructive conversations drive change and progress towards open platforms and greater competition. Apple's new policy is a step in the wrong direction. We hope they listen to feedback on their proposed plan and work towards a more inclusive future for all."" – Xbox president Sarah Bond calls out Apple's policy change to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act by allowing iOS developers to use third-party app stores, but only if they pay Apple €0.50 for each install per year after the first million.

I will say that it's very funny that Apple was trying to dissuade developers from ever using third-party app stores and the absolute least appealing thing they could come up with was to copy the Runtime Fee scheme Unity rolled out in all earnestness last year.

STAT | 2 months – The time span between a Krafton employee reporting to the company that an executive had sexually assaulted her at a work party after The Game Awards and the company firing her, according to her new wrongful termination lawsuit.

QUOTE | ""The games sector is Scotland's secret weapon. We have far more to offer Scotland's economy and future as a digital society than anyone realises."" – Is that a secret weapon in Scotland's pocket or is Scottish Games Network director Brian Baglow just happy to see the Scottish government's plans to develop a national strategy to support the games industry?

STAT | 40 months – How long it took Genshin Impact to hit $5 billion in lifetime consumer spending, according to Data.ai. That's a new record, beating the 51-month mark set be Clash of Clans.

QUOTE | ""It is clear to us that the old Nintendo model of proprietary hardware supported by compelling proprietary software is broken"" – The latest 10 Years Ago This Month column features this 2014 quote from Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who responded to the Wii U's difficult launch by suggesting Nintendo drop the system and make PS4 and Xbox One games until its next console was ready. He was wrong, but as the column shows, most people were wrong about what Nintendo's next moves would be, including Nintendo itself.

STAT | 3 – The number of political parties in Germany that have jointly proposed a number of possible restrictions around loot boxes, including an outright ban.

It should be very concerning to the industry that even in hyper-polarized political times, loot boxes are an issue that can get traction and calls for change from basically all points on the political spectrum.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg.large_2x.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp
